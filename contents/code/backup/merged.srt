Before we get into the content i just want to say thank you for joining the course my name is Adam and i will be your instructor. I've been typing for ever since i was a child but that will be talked about more in the who am i section i just wanted to formally introduce myself i wanted to thank you for taking the time out of your day to learn more more about the course and if you have any feedback or questions just know that i'm always here to help.

As you may already know by now typing is a very important skill to learn in today's society because everything that we've evolved to involves technology everything is a phone everything is a computer everything is a tablet and at the heart of it all.

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:33,160
Everything is communication and we communicate through typing. We've become so advance in that way and i think that's really the most important reason why we should learn how to type properly but not only that it offers a lot of other benefits as well which is going to be talked about now.

00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:13,920
As i previously mentioned society has adapted to technology and adapting to technology requires to adapt to typing and other than that i think that learning how to type properly actually provides a bunch of other benefits as well.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:26,830
Two of which i think are the most important one the most obvious is it increases productivity right if you type faster you get work done faster if you type faster you may be able to read faster all of that stuff.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:42,460
But i think personally. The most important thing for me. Is learning how to type properly is important because it advocates for proper health if you learn how to type properly you will reduce the strain on your hands you'll reduce the strain on your back.

4
00:00:42,540 --> 00:01:00,480
Reduce the strain on your neck all of which are so important for the longevity of yourself because at the end of the day typing is important yes but health is more important you're not going to be typing forever but you do want to increase your lifespan and the quality of your life because why wouldn't you.

00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:39,910
So who am i my name is Adam as you obviously already know from the introduction but i wanted to provide a little bit more credentials into why i think i can teach a typing course so ever since i was young I've always been a self taught typist it all started from video games but I've been learning every single year how to type better more efficiently by myself and currently i'm hovering at about one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy words per minute and while that may seem like a lot because it is i can't fail to recognize the routes from where i came from if you're first starting off typing don't be discouraged if you're typing twenty thirty forty words per minute because.

2
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:56,770
I was the same when i first started typing i was. Typing at twenty and thirty words per minute but i can assure you that practice makes perfect and eventually you'll be faster than you are now I've always taught a bunch of other people how to type properly including teachers students.

3
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:12,160
Coworkers friends family etc. And i think having this utomi course allows me to combine all of that all of my teachings all of my methods and secrets into one big package.

00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:24,880
Starting off with the most important thing ergonomics is the number one thing that you need when typing because it. Ensures that you have a long longevity when it comes to typing and making sure your wrists and your hands don't get messed up and the first ergonomic for success is sitting and that's because sitting allows you to put yourself in a position of success sitting properly.

2
00:00:24,930 --> 00:01:17,670
It not only helps you with better posture. And for better health but it also allows you to make sure your hands your fingers and your arms are in the proper spot for them to be ergonomic as well whenever i'm teaching i always want to emphasize on the po point that typing is not a race sure you can speed type but when you're practicing it's a marathon it's a marathon to make sure that you don't suffer any adverse health effects unnecessarily because you're not sitting in the proper spot or you're not typing in the proper spot it's more important for your health to be prioritized rough other than the speed there are three main points when it comes to sitting ergonomics and the last one is not as necessary but the first two definitely are the first two are the most important when it comes to sitting so the first point when it comes to sitting ergonomics is to not slouch over and to have a proper body posture.

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:30,040
For example you don't want to be slouch over like this and want to be typing on the keyboard for a long period of time as you can see this doesn't look healthy it's not right.

4
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:38,520
It's going to mess up your next get around your upper back and you're going to have a bunch of problems. When it comes to tightness of the muscles in the future.

5
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:53,970
So instead you want to have a nice straight posture with a nice aligned neck as you see it kind of aligns with my upper chest you don't want to have your neck poking out like this you want to have a nice.

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:31,980
Posture leaning against the back of your chair and the second ergonomic sitting point really depends on that first one of having proper body posture. The second point is making sure that your eyes are straight when it comes to what you're viewing and the reason that they're so closely correlated together is because if you're slouching over like this you won't have the proper eye vision that you're supposed to have which ergonomic he sets you up for success so now that you see that you have the proper body posture this is where your head position comes into play and this is where your eye vision comes into play as well.

7
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:57,300
You don't want you. You do want your eyes directly facing. The desktop you want it to be in level. I understand that also sometimes you won't be able to do so for example if you have a laptop and you have to look down on certain occasions but for the majority of the time that you're typing you want to make sure that you have them leveled and the reason for that is because of this.

8
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:05,460
Picture this if you're constantly looking down and you can most likely see it from from what you're viewing. If you're constantly looking down at a computer.

9
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:21,960
Or if you're constantly looking up at a computer. You can see how it can affect your neck it can. Really badly strain it and it can definitely do a lot of damage in the future so it's best to have a nice straight posture with a nice stay straight.

10
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:39,220
Leveled vision with what you're viewing and the last sitting ergonomic point is dependent on the chair and that's exactly why it's not as necessary i understand that a lot of people don't tend to have ergonomic chairs but if you do it's a bonus.

11
00:03:39,510 --> 00:04:24,670
Make sure that when you're sitting. You don't have the ninety degree angle which your back is sitting at instead. You have about one hundred to one hundred and ten degrees this is because when it's at one hundred or one hundred and ten degrees the disks are not fully pressured in your lower back kind of alleviating them a little bit but again it's not as necessary as one may think if your churches allow you to move back one hundred or one hundred and ten degrees then do do not worry it's completely fine to sit ninety degrees obviously is preferred if you sit a hundred and ten but in the long run it doesn't really make that big of a difference it's just a little bit more comfortable what's more important though is that you make sure that slouching.

12
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:46,680
And not having your eyes straight. Is prioritised you don't want to have for example when typing you don't want to have your. Neck looking up you don't want to have your neck looking down because that will create long term problems and lastly the most important tip that I've always found when it comes to sitting.

13
00:04:47,040 --> 00:05:14,700
Is move or round humans are not meant to sit and we're meant to move we're able bodied creatures as such and because of that every hour or so i like to get up move around walk around for a couple of minutes and then come back to my workstation because that is how we are made were not made to sit were made to walk and if you let your blood flow a little bit for the long run it will help you put yourself in a position.

00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:30,880
As you see here keep the keyboard in front of your chair directly in front of your chair as such this allows you to put your arm and your hands in the proper position in the proper ergonomic position to make sure that again you don't suffer any unnecessary health effects a bonus tip if you can elevate the keyboard just a little bit some keyboards have it automatically on the back some people use a book then that is also better for your wrists as well but it's not that big of a deal if you can't it's just a little bit of a bonus tip.

1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:16,770
So the first rule for proper arm ergonomics is based on the elbow position make sure that the elbow is. Straightly aligned and leveled with the keyboard while you're typing and make sure that you're not over extending the elbow.

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:43,510
You want it to have a nice comfortable all around forty five degree tilt. When typing to maximize the. Ergonomics you don't want it to be completely backed up like this and you don't want it to be completely outreach like this a nice middle is what you should be aiming for and the second rule for proper organon next is based off of making sure that.

3
00:00:43,650 --> 00:01:11,850
The arm. Is as straight as possible sure the elbow could be leveled with the keyboard but you also want your entire arm to be leveled with the keyboard to make sure that nothing is being overly strained and your arm is being relaxed and the hand placement are going to be using really depends on the typing method that you're going to be using but one good general rule of thumb that you should make sure you're always doing.

4
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:25,680
Is keeping your wrists straight for example if you try this right now if you flare out your arrests like this you're going to feel the press essure on your wrists there it's pretty bad and you can imagine that.

5
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:39,490
If you're typing for a long period of time keeping your wrists in this position for a long period of time. You can imagine the damage it'll do and. Once you immediately go back to straight rest you will feel how.

6
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:53,980
Relieved your wrists feel. So it's always best to have straight wrists. Coupled. With the straight elbows or that leveled elbows and the straight. Arms.


@@@
1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:28,780
The proper finger ergonomics all depends on the typing method that you're using but a good rule of thumb is to make sure that the keystrokes that you're doing are light and you're not jamming your fingers and you're taking breaks regularly our fingers are not made for typing so don't extremely rush into it and jam your fingers on your keyboard but take it lightly take it gradually so your fingers get accustomed to typing.

00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:10,950
So to give a quick and brief overview of touch typing i don't want to go into depth because i'm going to talk about it a lot in the touch typing section but you'll see on the basics and layout section.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:46,660
Each finger and touch typing has a specific function when typing a word so for example. The index finger on your left hand is responsible for four five rt fg and f b so when you're starting off and you want to write a word that starts with the letter t your index finger is going to write with t so that's pretty much the brief overview so just know that in touch typing each finger has it's own set function on the keyboard Ford has it's own set position and that certain fingers are used to type certain keys.


@@@
1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:10,120
So unconventional typing is actually just a hybrid between touch typing and the. Random muscle memory typing that you accustomed to while you're trying to learn how to type.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:26,800
And they're they're very similar a lot of people when ever i taught them. Whenever they unconventionally type. They always type the same between other people that also want to conventionally type it always usually resorts to the exact same shortcuts that everyone uses.

3
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:37,110
And again it's just a hybrid of. Touch typing and and whenever they are accustomed to so. Regardless of what you do if your right hand dominant left hand dominant which is what we're going to be talking about.

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:47,620
You're going to be using the fundamentals of touch typing. You're going to have your hands placed here or your fingers placed here your thumbs placed here and.


@@@
1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:22,450
As i said before take my advice with a grain of salt because everyone is going to learn differently which method you should use depends completely. On who you are and what you want to achieve in my experience touch typing takes a little bit longer to learn but allows you to type a bit faster i think that touch ping can reduce the strain.

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:35,580
On your wrists and your hands but it's never been proven it's just what i think touch typing also requires a bunch of practice in order to get proficient at it unconventional typing however it takes the same amount of practice but i think.

3
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:47,440
It allows you to naturally type faster the reason i i say that is because touch typing is extremely strict and if you want to just relax and you don't want to type.

4
00:00:47,700 --> 00:01:14,160
In a very strict manner. Allowing to unconvinced allowing yourself to unconventionally type just flows your fingers and allows you to just relax and just type it's it's difficult to explain but through personal experience that's what all my other students have said personally i think that unconventional is little bit more relaxed i think it will take quite a bit more time to learn just because if there's no real strict rule set and.
