00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,430
Hi and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,230
My name's Ian stables author of more than 50 books on Amazon Kindle.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,190
If you learn and practice everything in this course you will be able to complete any typing task in

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,720
far less time.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,980
It will be a skill that you will have for life.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,550
This will be good for you in your job.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,780
Most jobs and companies these days use computers.

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,230
And if you can do your typing in less time that's gonna be more productive for you.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,910
Also if you're a student naturally there's a lot of written work for students so that will speed up

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,150
that for you.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,940
If you're an author as I am and write books yourself you will be able to find that your complete your

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,800
books in far less time by learning to type.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,040
So what do most people do when they type.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,350
Most people just use two fingers.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,550
Well I say most people lots of people probably aren't my actually most people but you know how does

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,210
that compare with touch typing and why should you learn touch typing.

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,860
Well think about it when you use two fingers that's two fingers when you touch typing eight fingers

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,530
plus when you touch when you're using two fingers quite likely you're looking on the keyboard trying

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,130
to find where all the keys are.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,330
And that's not only distracting for you from your work that's going to take a lot longer than it is.

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,130
If you can look up at the screen and look where it is you want and you need to look at and you just

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,120
type away using your eight fingers on the keyboard.

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:48,840
So how is this course going to teach you touch typing Well it's actually an optimized way of learning.

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,770
This is essentially based on the latest research on skill learning.

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,770
And so this course is based on that.

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,060
And it's essentially easy to follow steps.

27
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:09,680
All you've got to do is learn and apply and practice so let's have a look at how the Course is structured

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,490
and how you're going to progress through and what you're going to learn as well.

29
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,230
So firstly you know we're going to just look at the keyboard you know where the keys are and then we're

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,620
going to go onto the most important keys.

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,310
These are called the home keys and also I'm going to show you how to always make sure your hands are

32
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,430
on those keys.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,630
And without that's without looking at the keyboard too You better do it without looking down.

34
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:45,820
And then we'll also talk about which fingers are used for what keys on the keyboard.

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,500
Let me be looking at how you need to practice.

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,020
So remember this is based on not to Mies way of practicing your skill learning is based on research

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,210
so it works.

38
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,120
And I've tested it myself and it really does work.

39
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:07,640
So I've created this course on typing based on that same principle so I'll be showing you what you need

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,120
to do so that you can practice and get the fastest results with accuracy.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,780
So essentially how long you need to practice for.

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,200
I'll be showing you the accelerator tip.

43
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:25,250
I call it an accelerated chip because it really does accelerate your practice just by doing this simple

44
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,180
thing.

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,900
It really does.

46
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,030
I'll be talking to you about that as well.

47
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,800
Then you need to know how to practice.

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,970
So that should be giving you drills to practice on.

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,420
But first you need to understand what you should do to practice properly with that set.

50
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:50,030
Then once you understand those things then we'll be moving on to the actual practice sessions.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,650
So we start with the most important keys.

52
00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:01,180
The home keys and in here you'll find and talk about each pair of keys at a time and quickly demonstrate

53
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,030
where you would need to put those and then how you would practice.

54
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:13,180
And after the home keys we move on to the other keys as well so you know the top row the bottom row

55
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:13,990
as well.

56
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,260
After that the end of these sections as well I'll be giving you downloadable practice sheets so you'll

57
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:27,130
find at the end of the each of these sections there will be a short video and then how to get those

58
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,490
practice sheets to practice with after you've got the letters practice because that's what we're doing

59
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,640
here.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,310
Letters then we'll be learning the numbers.

61
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:42,750
So of course naturally most typing tasks you won't be doing a lot of numbers and thus doing data entry.

62
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,730
However you know there will be times when you need to type numbers.

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,980
So again you can do that without looking down at the keyboard every time you're going to save a lot

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,690
of time.

65
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:00,990
So we talk you know giving you again drills to learn all the numbers on the top row on your keyboard.

66
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,510
And again as a practice sheet at the end of that section so you can practice that as well.

67
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,640
OK.

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:16,490
After the numbers were we talking about three important keys and how to practice those.

69
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,230
So essentially there's gonna be capital letters.

70
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,550
OK that's one of the keys that you'll be learning in this part and I'll be showing you the really easy

71
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,200
way to learn and prepare to practice typing capital letters without again looking at your keyboard because

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,070
that's what all was what touch typing is about when we've done all of that on your practice and learn

73
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,750
all the keys and you can do everything.

74
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,760
By this time you will be at its height all the keys and numbers will note looking at your keyboard and

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,950
then we'll be talking about how you go on to improve your speed.

76
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,260
So that's essentially what it is.

77
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,240
So you don't get into the course and learn and follow the drills.

78
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,160
Remember you must practice there's no point in just watching the course and then expecting results.

79
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,860
You know it's a skill it's like driving a car at no point learning how to drive a car you need to actually

80
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,410
get in the car and it's the same with typing it's like everything else and the more you do it the better

81
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,260
you will be and the faster you will be OK.

82
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,850
No I really do my age limit i want to make sure that you really do learn this skill so if there's any

83
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,580
questions or anything you're struggling a little bit with or anything like that on the dashboard you'll

84
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:36,000
notice here there's a Q and A section just click on that and you can add a question here and know what

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,270
it is I will respond.

86
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,510
I may not be straight away and some on my computer at the time but as soon as I check my questions of

87
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,320
I see that you put a question in there I will respond as quick as I possibly can.

88
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,930
Now what I'd like to add here as well hopefully I've done this I spent lots of time on this course making

89
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,880
sure that it is designed to give you the best results possible.

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,850
If however there's something that you think could be improved or you'd like something added to the course

91
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:12,390
something extra you know please let me know about it by popping a question here in the Q and A section

92
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,450
in the course and I'll get back to you if you like the course as well you know be lovely if you leave

93
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,600
a review doesn't need to be you know a lot of words just a few words will do and just let everybody

94
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,810
else know that you've also enjoyed the course now it's up to you when if and when you do that review

95
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,850
I probably suggest though you wait until you get to the end of the course before you leave your review

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
because then you will know you know you would have seen the whole course.

97
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,860
OK so with that let's get on with the first lecture.

@@@
1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:09,370
This is a standard keyboard that you're likely to find on most computers and laptops.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,370
It's known as the quality keyboard because of the arrangement of the keys.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:24,230
So if you look on the top left keys here letter keys you'll see it spells quality q w e r t y.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,220
Now you might say well why didn't they design a keyboard worse and you know it goes in like a b c d

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,490
e f g and so on through the alphabet.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,810
Well originally when keyboards were first designed.

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:48,130
If the person was able to type too fast the keys used to get jammed because in the old style typewriters

8
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,150
you had the keys where they would all go into the center that used metal arms would go up with each

9
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:03,070
letter on and off some most to type too quick those letters would become jammed so they decided to change

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,230
the keyboard to what we see today.

11
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:15,430
The Corti keyboard so that that stopped people being able to type too fast and therefore not jamming

12
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,710
the keys on the typewriter but we're now stuck with this form of keyboard.

13
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,220
There are other keyboards out there but this is the normal keyboard arrangement that you're gonna have

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,280
for the letters and you can still type very very very fast on it.

15
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:39,370
OK so the keys on here the ones that you're gonna be typing the most are essentially going to be these

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,390
so you can see all of the letters here.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,460
You're gonna be typing along with a code on here you're going to be typing using these keys here across

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,300
the bottom of course also the shift keys.

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,190
No you don't already know the shift key is the one where you press hope to hold it down.

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,140
And then if you type a letter it makes it a capital letter.

21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,750
And if you're trying to get a call on say here is the same you call on call on.

22
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,180
If you just type it it will give you a call semicolon.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,920
If you want to call on which is above this one you hold the Shift key down first and then press it and

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,310
it will give you the code long to normally find that when those keys you'll find different things above

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,030
and below the keys to get the one above you would hold down the shift key first and get up on the course

26
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,890
the enter key here or the return key.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,990
And so what you refer to it only that one is what gives you a new line so if you try typing and you

28
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,540
finish a paragraph and you want to come down you'd press to enter key and that would then give you a

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,260
new line depending on your line spacing on your computer.

30
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,150
Normally if it's one single line spacing you press the Enter key twice.

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,980
So that would put a space between the next paragraph on the previous one.

32
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,330
So those are the main keys that we're going to focus on in this course because let's face it unless

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,300
you're doing data entry lots of figures and numbers and numbers are not going to be used as frequently

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,800
as what the letters are.

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,150
So that's what we're mean you're going to focus on here.

36
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,060
Now if you'll notice all the numbers are across the top.

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,740
And you know so that's where you'll find your numbers.

38
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,820
Now some key keyboards like this one and also like mine on my laptop will have a key part over here

39
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,700
on the right hand side.

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,690
So if you are doing something where are you required to type blocks and dots and numbers in or like

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,140
data entry or something like that then it's probably suggested that you would use the key part instead

42
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,710
of this because the if you practice and learn how to use the keyboard you can type the numbers a lot

43
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,150
quicker than what you were trying to use your these keys at the top.

44
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,450
However in normal typing you will be called upon to do where you will put the use the numbers where

45
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,660
for example you would type a date or a year or something like that then you'll be using the numbers.

46
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,980
Now I'm not going to focus on those too much at the beginning I'm just going to get you proficient at

47
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,370
using all of these keys here and read the numbers you can get those later on and when you do need a

48
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,650
number which will be far and few between.

49
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,390
At first you may well have to keep looking down at your keyboard to find those keys.

50
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,850
But on this course we're going to focus on just using these keys and getting you proficient so that

51
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,340
you're able to type them without looking at a keyboard.

52
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,470
And later on you'll be at to even without thinking you'll see a word and just type it think a bit the

53
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,200
more the more you practice than the easier it's gonna become and the less thinking you'll need to do

54
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,460
when you're actually typing.

55
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,270
So it's like when you learn to drive first you'll be thinking of is a manual control car with gears

56
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,030
then you're probably at first when you start to drive you'll be looking at you know where the gears

57
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,880
are which borders the clutches or the brake is an accelerator and so on.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,460
And it's only then after practice when you keep doing it over and over again you'll be able to eventually

59
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,190
be able to drive your car without even thinking about where it appears horror who you thought you'd

60
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,600
be changing gears without even thinking about it.

61
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,860
And it's the same with typing.

62
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,390
The more that you do it more practice that you get you'll find that you'll be able to eventually just

63
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,660
type words without thinking about where the keys are.

64
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,130
So with that let's move on.

@@@
1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,400
Now I'm going to teach you something and this is very valuable and it's very important as well.

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,020
So on the key board there are these eight keys.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,600
These keys are known as the home keys.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,340
The reason for that is because that is the position that day four fingers on your left hand on your

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,140
right hand should always start from.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,980
Because then from that position it means you will then know where all of the other keys are from that

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,610
position but they're actually looking.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:39,450
So on the left it's a SDF and on the right it's J K L and semicolon.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,740
And of course you can get the colon on that as well.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,440
So I'm not going to show you how you can find those keys without looking because it's quite important

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,840
because when you're actually typing you don't want to keep looking too so that you can put your your

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,970
fingers back in that position again.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,890
So it is a really easy way of doing it.

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,920
So there's these two keys here the F and the J.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:11,080
Your essentially on your left hand index finger goes on the F and your right hand index finger goes

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,410
on the J.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,920
So how to find that without even looking is on each of these keys.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,630
There is a little protrusion little lump that you'll feel when you touch these keys so what you do what

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,420
you want.

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,860
What I want you to do now is get your left index finger and put it on the FCC and then your right index

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,800
finger place that on the J key and I want you to feel that lump on the key.

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,100
OK.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:47,820
No do that now know when your key your fingers are correctly positioned on those two keys.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,330
Your other three fingers will be there incorrectly positioned above the other home keys.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,610
So with your left index finger on the F you'll notice that your big finger will be on the D.

26
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:09,790
Your ring finger on the s and your a little finger will be on the a similarly with the right hand your

27
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,190
index finger will be on the J.

28
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,070
Your long finger Longest Finger bill on the K during finger on the L on your little finger of course

29
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,290
on where there's a semicolon and of course the call on there as well.

30
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,730
Don't worry about that just yet.

31
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,240
So this essentially is the home case.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,290
So you need to always have your fingers in these on these keys when you are typing course yes you need

33
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,270
to move your fingers to reach other keys but they will always return back to these keys when you've

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,120
typed the letter that you wish to type and you're going to learn these in in a very easy way.

35
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,370
And following the practice exercises that I'm going to give you shortly.

36
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,050
So that's the first lesson.

37
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,670
Knowing where your home keys.

38
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,240
So what I want you to do is just do a little bit of practice getting used to finding those.

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,060
So at first you might need to look at your keyboard.

40
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,010
But I want to what I want you to try and do is look away from your keyboard and try to find those keys

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,880
without looking at your keyboard so just look away from your keyboard look up and then put your hands

42
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:23,020
on the keys until you find those two little lumps with your left and your right index fingers.

43
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,330
That way you know know when you found that that your index finger is correct the above the F and your

44
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,830
right above the J.

45
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:37,060
And your other three fingers will fall nice and neatly above the other keys know when you have those

46
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,030
four fingers you may also notice that both of your thumbs for naturally over this key here at the bottom

47
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,870
which is called the spacebar the spacebar is what you use if you don't already know to create a space

48
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,400
or between words and sentences.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,950
And so on.

50
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,500
So that's very important.

51
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,840
So as you can see from this position you can type those four home keys and put spaces in between what

52
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,630
you type and from there all the other keys you'll be able to find them without looking.

@@@
1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,030
So now you've got used to where your fingers go on the home keys.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,020
I'm not going to get you to practice anything yet.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:16,080
I'm just going to show you how your fingers in which fingers move around the keys on your keyboard.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,810
So let's start with our left hand.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:29,080
Small finger which is on the a key so that finger is responsible for the ay of course because it's covering

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,420
that key is a home key.

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:37,920
From there it can move downwards below to get the Z on above to get the cue.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,430
Also if you're typing a number that would be number one.

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,900
Now I'll be showing the numbers as well because when you do the numbers later on you know this shows

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,250
you which finger goes to the number.

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:01,330
But of course what we're going to do in this course is get used to typing the letters rather than the

12
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,450
numbers for an hour later on.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,610
You can probably practice the numbers yourself when you're more proficient with the letters.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,090
So that's the left key.

15
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,450
Now if we move to our left ring finger these are the keys that would be responsible for.

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:23,020
So it's resting above the s on the home keys that will then go downwards to get the x above to get the

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,540
W..

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,240
And you know if when it's a number that would be number two then a long long finger of our left hand

19
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:38,230
or the forefinger is the D which is resting above that on the hunger and then it can go down to get

20
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,140
the C above to get the e..

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,750
And of course the three if you wish.

22
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm going to continue mentioning the numbers you can see that for yourself from now on just the letters.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,980
So the next one is our middle finger.

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,640
Now this one's got more kids to be responsible for.

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,450
This has got actually six letter keys not counting the numbers.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,430
So the R left index finger will be resting on the home keys and will be above the F so the f is straight

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,500
away you can press that it's already resting on it but for now if it moves it down you can get the V

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:21,220
or above and get the R and also it can move to the right to get the letter G and diagonally to the right

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,640
above to get the T and diagonally below to get the B.

30
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,890
There's a reason why it's responsible for more letters because the right hand finger would have to stretch

31
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:41,470
too far to get the T G and B it's more natural for the f k your index finger to reach these letters.

32
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,880
Now we move to the right hand so again starting with our right our small finger on our right hand.

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,530
So that's resting on the home keys that's above.

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,260
If you press that down it will give you the colon on key or if you hold the shift key down we'll give

35
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,640
you the colon and then of course we move our little finger down.

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,330
That will give us the forward slash or if you want in the question.

37
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,170
Question mark.

38
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:14,320
David hold the shift key down the left hand and then press that key to get a question mark and then

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:22,140
above we move our little finger above to get the letter P. And then of course moving into our ring finger

40
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,030
of her right hand that's resting comfortably above the L on the home keys.

41
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,400
So just press down to get the L..

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,770
If you move it down you can get the comma.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,550
No you know there's a greater symbol which can get more pressing shift but that's probably less commonly

44
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,010
used more likely to be pressing a comma.

45
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:50,110
So you just move your ring finger down to get the comma move ring finger above to get the oh landmark

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,410
big finger of our right hand.

47
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,910
So again that one's as you can see above the letter K. and we would.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,040
Sorry I beg your pardon mummy talked about the F sorry.

49
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,660
Beg your pardon.

50
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,730
When you move the ring finger of your right hand down below the L you're getting a full stop.

51
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,920
Sorry I beg your pardon.

52
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,410
Not the comma as I said.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,490
So that would be the full stop.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,120
So the big finger of our right hand is above the K when we move that down.

55
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:23,710
We get the comma and then if we move our big finger up ports above the K we get the eye.

56
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,020
So those are letters that that finger is responsible for.

57
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,430
And then finally our index finger her right hand.

58
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,640
So like the left hand index finger it's also responsible for six letter keys not counting the numbers.

59
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,460
So it's resting above the J So you press that down.

60
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,780
We get the J.

61
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,700
If you move it up below the J we get an m move above the J.

62
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,030
We get you.

63
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,600
And as you can see we move our index finger.

64
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,510
One key to the left to give us an H.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,940
And if you move it diagonally down to the left we get the N and diagonally to the left above.

66
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,920
We get the Y.

67
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,390
So it's pretty obvious when you're seeing on the screen like this but when we come when you're not looking

68
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,880
at the keyboard as you're able to see on the screen now you're off to do this from memory.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,130
But please don't worry you'll easily be able to do this if you follow my instructions in this course

70
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,470
and go through the practice exercises.

@@@
1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:08,630
So before we actually start practicing typing learning to type those you need to understand a few things.

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,450
So how to make the fastest progress note is the wrong way.

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,880
And there is a right way by following the methods in this.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,530
This is based on lots and lots of research conducted to show the best ways of acquiring a new skill

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,060
like typing.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,420
So we'll be showing you what keys to practice what keys to practice and a time on the keyboard.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,790
We'll also be showing you how long to practice or the optimum time to practice typing.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,400
And also I'll be showing you what speed to type as well when you practice.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,940
And I'll be showing you what I've named.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,510
The accelerator is quite a good technique.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:58,310
Quite a simple thing to do but it really does improve your progress a lot so how do we actually practice.

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:04,370
Well the usual way that lots of people will do it if they teach themselves that type is they will get

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,870
some text and they will try to practice the text and then first a bit of the keys and eventually learn

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,420
to do it without looking at the keys.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,300
And you can do that.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,620
And that's the way that I did it right at the start until I discovered a better way to practice.

17
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,940
So the better way to practice is this.

18
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,010
Don't try to practice lots of different keys all at the same time.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,860
We're just going to be focusing on the two keys at a time not hours and hours and hours just doing the

20
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,730
same two keys over and over again until you get the two keys and then move on to the next one.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,360
But no two keys at a time but each combination you'll be just practicing for two sec.

22
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,720
So I should say two seconds 30 seconds sessions for each two keys and then you move on to another two

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,270
keys for 30 seconds.

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,960
Another two keys with 30 seconds and so on and then you go back to the first two keys.

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,270
Practice those again for 30 seconds and continue on through like that.

26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,590
So what this actually does is it means that you don't get bored.

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,900
Some more likely to do it again the next day and the next day after that.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,340
But also by doing it for 30 seconds for two keys and a note it's two keys for 30 seconds so on get you

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,230
used to using not more than one key because eventually you're not just going to be typing to keep two

30
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,510
letter key two letter words you're going to be typing longer words and long text.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,230
So by doing it 30 seconds for two keys at a time will give you enough practice to learn where those

32
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:42,830
keys are and also to get faster at typing those two keys in combination but also when you come to type

33
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,910
words and longer text you will find that you'll be a lot faster by first just starting out by practicing

34
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,740
two keys at a time.

35
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,450
Essentially I recommend that you practice each day between for 20 to 30 minutes.

36
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,150
I don't suggest that you sit at your computer typing for an hour or two three or four hours a day because

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,180
you might be forgiven for thinking that you know if I practice four hours a day instead of 30 minutes

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,980
I'm going to make faster progress.

39
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,640
Well arguably you might but it's actually you make progress has been proven that you make fastest progress

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,550
not by the amount of time that you spend practicing each day but it's actually the frequency of her

41
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,020
practice.

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,210
So it's daily practice that is the key.

43
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:37,380
So practice every single day for one to two sessions for about 20 to 30 minutes at a time.

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:46,490
And that will give you the best best results what does it also tell you to do here is start slowly because

45
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:52,370
what you don't want to be doing is if you're practicing typing and you keep messing up and typing the

46
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,760
wrong keys over and over again eventually it's gonna be a habit and it's gonna be a habit heartless

47
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,100
hard to break.

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,840
So it's important that you start slowly even painfully slowly if you wish were.

49
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,360
However slowly it takes you whatever it is make sure that you get hit each key right the first time

50
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,580
every time you do it and then you can gradually increase your speed.

51
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,270
So that's why I suggest you do when you're doing your 30 second practices start really slowly at first

52
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,800
rate especially at the start when you're getting to learn where the keys are and finding them on the

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,320
keyboard without looking.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,740
You need to start really slowly get it right and then increase your speed.

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,710
Now when you increase your speed if you start noticing and making mistakes then it's just a kind of

56
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,430
scrunched slightly slowing his speed down again.

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,090
And getting it right.

58
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:52,390
And then once again try to increase your speed just slowly increase your speed and keep your accuracy.

59
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,120
That is key to learning to type following this method.

60
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,380
Now here is what I call the accelerator.

61
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,030
Now it's a really simple thing but it actually does give really really good results.

62
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,490
Essentially this practice before you go to bed.

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,390
So why is that important.

64
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:17,690
Well I actually found out this technique as somebody who was learning an instrument a keyboard most

65
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:25,910
trying to practice certain you know put a piece of music on the keyboard and his progress was you know

66
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,040
like most people quite slow and sometimes painful.

67
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,020
And what he found was is that when you practice before you go to bed.

68
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,450
Course after you're practicing you sleep.

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,660
And that's when your mind recharges itself for the next day.

70
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:51,110
And it's been found improved that you actually make faster progress if you do it before you go to sleep.

71
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,630
I'm somewhat going to give you all the science behind it but just let me tell you that it does work.

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,510
The first person who was practicing the keyboard he found that when you practice a piece of night nice

73
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,350
and slowly being accurate making sure he did it right.

74
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,630
Not mistakes.

75
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,900
He noticed that the next day when he woke up when you practice again his ability improved dramatically.

76
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,680
A lot different than what he did when he was practicing through the day.

77
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,350
So I would strongly suggest that if you're going to practice Do your practice if he can try to fit it

78
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,110
in for 20 to 30 minutes before you go to bed at night you'll find that you're going to make a lot faster

79
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,830
progress.

80
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:38,150
So next it's time to actually start practicing and learning to type.

@@@
1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,790
Now it's time to do the practice sessions to learn to type to touch type.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:15,350
So first of all go through each video and then at the end of each video practice the key combination

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,090
that I show you and move on to the next video and practice that.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,610
So first of all we're going to be working on the middle Keys.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,710
That's the home keys including the G and H.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,330
And that will be you getting used to those keys.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,930
And then what I want you to do is to continue practicing those keys until you get proficient at it.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,160
Now once you watch the videos and gone through each combination by watching the videos.

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:50,150
Then you just simply continue your practice by following the practice sheets which I'll give you a pair

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,870
to download those after we finished the section on the middle Keys.

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,970
From then on we'll do the same thing with the top Keys first the left hand then the right hand.

12
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,490
So again I'll be a video on each one of those key combinations.

13
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,600
And at the end practice sheets for you to get used to those.

14
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,270
And then of course finally we'll do the left and right hand keys for the bottom row of keys.

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,870
So that's how we're going to follow this here.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,050
So essentially what I want you to do is get proficient at the middle Keys first by practicing those

17
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:33,920
women you're OK and familiar with where to put your fingers typing those keys during the practice drills

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,070
the exercises then you'll be able to move on to the next section of practice which is getting used to

19
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:47,360
the top keys get proficient at those keys on both hands and when you're proficient at those you then

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,230
finally be able to move and getting the bottom keys to get those right.

21
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,760
Once you've done that you will then be ready to move on to the next step.

@@@
1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,300
So here is the first two keys you're going to practice for 30 seconds.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:13,170
So simply the a and the s so back and forth without spaces just a essay essay as a.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,320
So if you're up when your keys are on the home keys you find that your little finger will be over the

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,870
ay on your left ring finger will be over the s.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,360
So simply you'll be just getting used to used to these two keys.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,560
So remember start slowly just getting used to not looking at the keyboard.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,070
Just press the A and the.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,160
Slowly I can forth back and forth back and forth getting used to the.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,380
They are without looking at the keys.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,490
So just simply look the screen if you like freeze the video where you're looking out for 30 seconds

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,750
and type those two and then once you've done the 30 seconds we'll be ready to move onto the next two

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,380
letters.

@@@
1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:09,450
Now here here's the next two keys so you'll be using the typing the a deed back and forth again remember.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,550
Start slowly and then gradually build at speed as time goes on.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,310
Just doing this for 30 seconds each time you do these two letters.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,660
So as you haven't guessed it already if your fingers are correctly over the comb keys you were using

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:32,230
your little finger and your big finger to type these keys a little finger of course over the a big finger

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,070
over the D.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,570
So just do that for 30 seconds and then move on to the next video for the next two letters.

@@@
1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,570
Now for our next two letters the aye and the F so the little finger of a left hand of the aye and R

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:16,400
index finger left hand is over the F so we'll be practising those two keys for thirty seconds when you've

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,010
done not.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,930
Then it's time to move on to the next two letters.

@@@
1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,300
The next two letters to come practice in combination are the A and G.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,650
So the small finger as you know know is over the a because you've been doing that a few times and the

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,590
G is by moving your index finger from off the FCC over to the G.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,900
Well I suggest you probably try and do if you can't.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,520
When you press the G move your finger quickly back to the F and as you press the A no no.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,760
Okay.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,890
You're used to moving your finger off from the F over to get the G properties up for 30 seconds and

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,680
then go on to the next to let a combination.

@@@
1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,560
No we're doing the S and D in combination.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,660
So practiced this for 30 seconds going backwards and forwards.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,940
So just sd sd sd like not so just remind you if you're not already.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:22,530
You should already know no as the S's over your left ring finger and you use the big finger of your

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:29,040
left hand to press the day when you've done that then we'll move on to the next two letters.

@@@
1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,690
The next is s and f practice these two letters in combination.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,080
One after the other.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,080
So again the S is on your left ring finger the F on your left index finger.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,340
So practice those for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,390
Now for our next two letter combination to practice together.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,330
So this is S and G.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,620
So the S You don't need to be to keep telling you after a while I'm sure you'll know which ones which

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,820
fingers are for what keys.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,640
But it's the s under the left index.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,120
So I left ring finger and your left index finger moves from the F to the G.

@@@
1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:09,270
The next two let a combination to practice for 30 seconds is D and F the D course is under your pig

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,460
finger on your left hand and the F as you know on your left index finger.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,540
So practice that for 30 seconds and then move on to the next two letters.

@@@
1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:09,790
Now we're going to practice d d and g keys so the left the big finger press the D and then use your

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,120
index finger to move from the F to the G.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,280
And like we did with the A earlier try for calm after pressing the G to quickly move your index finger

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,330
back to the F as you press the D key and that will give you practice moving your finger from the F to

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,270
get over to that G letter.

@@@
1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,650
And know the final two letters we're practicing with our left hand F and G.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,450
So this is just using our index finger to get us used to going from the F to G a bit more practice on

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:12,960
that.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,270
So f and g for 30 seconds and then boom move on to the next part.

@@@
1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,210
Here's the next two keys.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,830
No gonna work on our right hand.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:14,060
So our little fingers over the coal on our ring finger on our right hand is over the L so we're just

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:20,230
gonna practice these two keys like we did before for 30 seconds and then we'll move on to the next two

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,010
keys.

@@@
1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:08,080
Here's our next two keys so the little finger over the cool on again this time our big right finger

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,870
over the K so we're gonna practice those two packing for a full 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,450
Never practicing the cool on an.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:10,260
So the small finger is our colon and our index finger on our right hand on the J.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,820
So practice those two keys in accommodation for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,670
No practicing the coin key again with our little finger.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:14,720
With the H and b you do that by moving our right index finger to the left to hit the HK so practice

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,740
those two keys back and forth for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:08,430
Now we're going to practice these two keys together the L and the K so the L is r right in the right

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,980
key finger under K of course is our long finger on the right hand.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,280
So practice these two for 30 seconds and move on to the next to.

@@@
1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:10,290
No we're going to practice the L and J together so again the L is with our right hand ring finger on

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,050
the Jays our right hand index finger.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,160
So we're just gonna practice those two together for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,240
Now we're going to practice the L and J and L and H together.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,280
Beg your pardon.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,570
So again the L is our right hand ring finger and never going to practice moving getting the J.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,620
Sorry the H will get it right in a minute.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,470
So we move our index finger from the J.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,780
The left to press the H.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,960
So we're just gonna practice.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,860
No the L and H for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,910
No it's time to practice K and J.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,790
So that's our big finger and our index finger of our right hand.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,510
So practice those two keys for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:08,060
Now we're gonna practice the K and H together so again the K with our big finger of long finger of our

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,710
right hand and will move our index finger to the left from the J where it rests to get the HK so practice

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,510
not for thirty seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,390
And the last combination for the middle row of keys was our right hand again using our index finger

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,990
we're going to practice the J and the K back and forth.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,580
So it's the J.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,890
Pressing down and moving our index finger to the left to press the H.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,690
I'm gonna do that back and forth for 30 seconds.

@@@
1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,330
So now it's time to continue your practice for your home case.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:14,610
So with the short lectures I've shown you the position of each key in which fingers to use for each

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,420
one of course.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,310
So now you need to get your practice sheets so that you can continue practicing those in your 20 to

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,380
30 minutes a day.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,950
Remember 30 seconds per each combination.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:36,840
No in the next lecture after this one finishes you will be shown a screen like this one here and on

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,990
it you will see this little blue link that is below my computer.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,960
If you click on that that will then load a box where you can then download this to your computer and

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,160
then loaded up and then have it on the screen or print it out.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,560
Better still if you want it next to your computer.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,340
Or you could have it.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,030
So you can have that screen on say one side of your computer screen and your word processor on the other

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,350
side so you can actually practice typing in their when you get your practice sheets.

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,310
You will see the left hand keys that we've gone through the whole case.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,650
On the other hand then of course the right key.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:17,990
Right.

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,520
Fingers know the right keys for your right hand as well.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,530
Now beneath that you will see further practice where you're practicing the home keys with both hands.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,630
No I didn't need to create lectures to demonstrate how to press those keys using both hands.

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,900
Because we've of course already gone through the positions of these keys on your keyboard as we've gone

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,110
through left and right hands and the lectures.

23
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,000
So what I suggest you do is practice the left hand and the right hand combinations and then do both

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,530
hand combinations as well and just go round the brain keep doing that and to competent enough with those

25
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,420
keys so you can do all the exercises without looking down at your keyboard when you're competent enough

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,350
for that then so continue to practice of course your typing because the more you practice the better

27
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:16,100
you get but then you will be able to as long as you're competent enough then it's time to move on to

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,660
the next sessions which is looking and learning the top row on your keyboard.

@@@
1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,710
So in this section you're going to learn the top row of letters and I'm going to be showing you in the

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,680
following lectures one at a time.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,290
Which finger you would use to press each of these keys and then you will be able to practice those.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,260
I'm going to practice them in combination with the keys that you've already learned which is of course

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,930
the letters on the middle row.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,100
So each letter you're going to practice in combination with the letters on the middle row one at a time

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,670
and that will give you the benefit of that is that you'll be then used to getting the top key and getting

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,100
it from after pressing whatever key it is you press on the middle.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,000
And of course by doing that they're not only able to improve your speed later on when you come to actually

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,520
type text but also it will help you learn that key very very well so that you'll get to the point where

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,630
you're confident that you don't need to look at the keyboard.

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,440
So at the end of this section you actually have the opportunity of downloading a practice sheet where

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,800
it will give you each key combination to practice which you'll practice.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,860
Each combination for 30 seconds each.

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,740
So with that let's get on to learning the first key.

@@@
1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,320
So no for our first key in the top row of letters.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,910
So we're going to practice first.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,570
The Q So you already know where your keys are now on their home keys.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,650
You know the keys on the middle row so don't need to teach.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,430
It was again because you've hopefully being practiced and knows now can do those without looking at

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,030
the keyboard.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,540
So first is that Q.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,650
So essentially we're gonna do a Q in combination so the finger that you used to press the Q is the same

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,440
key you press the a with.

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,540
So that's a small finger on your left hand.

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:47,060
So simply first to 30 seconds of a Q and then when you've done that 30 seconds of S Q 30 seconds of

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,600
Dean Q f ing Q Jay.

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:57,050
Q and continue across the board like that so that when you've done all those fingers that you've been

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:04,340
practicing on the middle row and you do them in combination back and forth with the Q 30 seconds each.

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:11,810
No there's the practice sheet after these lectures which will give you something that you can use to

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,290
practice with which will give you these combinations to practice.

@@@
1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,800
Now for our next letter on the top row which is the W and again we're going to practice back and forth

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,850
in two letter combinations with the keys on the middle row to get used to the W and pressing them also

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,600
in combination with all the keys that you've learned in practice so far so the W is pressed with the

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,210
same finger that you press the s with.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,720
So that's your left hand ring finger.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,870
So that's the finger that you use to press the W.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:40,650
So again you'll be practicing each of these letters with the W for 30 seconds each across the middle

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,840
row of keys.

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,630
And like I said in The Last Lecture at the end of this section for the top row you will find your practice

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,630
sheets which you can print off if you like or just have them on your computer screen next to a word

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,560
processor where you can practice these keys.

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,190
So that's the W.K..

@@@
1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,860
The next key to practice is the E and the E is pressed with the same key that you press the D with.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,350
So that's your longest finger on your left hand.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,370
So once again you practice for 30 seconds each.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,030
The e with a one with one of the letters on the middle row for 30 seconds of each letter so the E for

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,830
instance for instance EAA for thirty seconds.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,660
Yes and so on and so on.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,740
So that's the E.

@@@
1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,310
No for the letter R and R is you press not using the same finger that you press to F so that's the index

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,770
finger of your left hand.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,270
So once again 30 seconds each.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,270
You're gonna practice the R in combination back and forth with each of the letters across the middle

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,310
and that all of these practice sessions will be in your practice sheet at the end of the section as

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,550
well.

@@@
1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,040
No.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:09,330
For the letter t the letter T is pressed using the same finger that you press the f key with.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,630
So again your index finger is used so you use the indexing finger for the R but we also use it for the

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,250
T as well.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,370
So 30 seconds each.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:28,170
So t with these t with f g h j and so on right across the board 30 seconds each and once again these

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,540
are all in your practice sheet at the end of this section.

@@@
1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,390
No still with the top Keys we're going to work from the right hand side.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,500
So I could have start from the left I suppose but just seemed logical to start from the right.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,930
So the letter P so the finger that you used to pass the P is the same finger you reduce to get the semicolon

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,600
which is your right hand small finger.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,040
So that's the key that's the finger that you used to press the letter P.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:34,090
So once again you re practicing each key in turn across the bottom one at a time for 30 seconds each.

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,540
So P L K P J for 30 seconds P and H with 30 seconds and so on.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,810
That's the letter piece of practice that one.

@@@
1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,440
No for the next letter.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,140
That's the O.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,650
And as you may have already now getting the idea.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,830
The finger that you used to press the o is the same key that you pressed the l.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,440
So that is your right hand ring finger.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,030
So once again you just simply go through 30 seconds each.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,010
OJ OJ OJ so on for 30 seconds the same with O H G.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,430
And so on all the way across.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,380
And like I said earlier this these exercises will all be in your practice sheets at the end of this

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:34,920
section.

@@@
1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,180
No for the letter I.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,670
The letter I as you may have guessed is pressed with the same key you press the letter key key.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,830
The letter K so that is your long finger on your right hand.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,830
So once again thirty seconds each along with each key in the middle.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,600
Press the wrong key there so it's simply across the keyboard.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,420
Like so I along with all of those keys.

@@@
1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,430
Now we're going to practice and learn the latter.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,760
You saw the letter you express with the same finger that you pressed the letter J.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,020
So that is your as you.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,990
Or it may have guessed your index finger of your right hand.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,710
So once again you're going through each of the letters one at a time for thirty seconds each in combination

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,240
with the letter you.

@@@
1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:08,860
I know for the last letter in the top row so it's the letter Y you press the letter y with the same

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,910
finger that you press the letter J with.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,770
So that is your index finger of your right hand.

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:22,390
So once again you practice the 30 seconds come in combination with each of these letters on the middle

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,210
row one at a time which will of course also these will appear in your practice sheets.

@@@
1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,730
So you have now learned all the top keys or the keys in the top row or the letter keys that is in the

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,810
top row.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,470
You've learned those and practiced them each 30 seconds each.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,510
Now I want you to continue practicing those.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:23,030
Just keep keep practicing over and over until you're able to type all the keys without looking down

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,350
at your keyboard.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,510
So to help you do that.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,000
I've included a practice sheet.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,980
You can download to your computer so you can either print it off and then have it next to your computer

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,270
or if you wish you can have it on your computer and have it.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,060
So it's next to your word processor and then you can type and practice it that way.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,540
So you get your practice sheet by clicking on this link here.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,650
So this is the next lecture.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,520
So just after this lecture finishes the next lecture it will be this screen click on this link here

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:03,100
which says top keys practice top PDA F and that will then allow you to download it to your computer.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,800
Now on the practice sheets you'll notice there's three sections.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,300
The first section is the top left keys and then the second section is the top right keys.

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,280
But below that then there is a section for all the top keys so that's essentially where you're practicing

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,610
a combination of all the top keys.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,640
One other time to remember each client key combination 30 seconds each and continue practicing over

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,780
and over when you are then competent so that you can type all the keys without looking at your keyboard

22
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,310
then it's time to move on to the next section which is the bottom keys.

@@@
1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:09,300
So in this section we're going to learn and practice the keys on the bottom row.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,020
So I'm going to be showing you one at a time which finger you would use to press each of these keys

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,840
and of course to really learn them and get the benefit of it.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,380
You're gonna be practice some in combination with the keys that you've already learned on the middle

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:31,030
row which include your home keys benefit that is so not only will you be faster when you come to do

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:38,020
actual typing of text but also you're going to really learn these keys so well that you won't need to

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,020
look at the keyboard which is the whole point of touch typing which makes you faster at the end of this

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,930
section of course like the last section you will then have the opportunity of downloading a practice

9
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:56,290
sheet giving you each of these letter combinations to practice so you'll be practicing each letter combination

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,000
like before for 30 seconds each.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,390
So with that let's get going get on and learn the first letter.

@@@
1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,890
So the first letter that we're going to learn and practice is the letter Z.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,570
So the letter Z you press that key with the same finger that you pressed the letter A with on the left

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,440
hand that is your small fingers or the small fingers used for the A as well as the Q and the Z.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,250
So never going to practice and learn the Z key.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,300
So do this for 30 seconds and you're going to do it for 30 seconds as well in combination one at a time

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,930
with all of the letters across the middle row.

@@@
1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,240
No we're going to learn the X unpacked just not the X is pressed using the key the finger that you used

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,950
to press the letter S which is the same one you used to press the letter W.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,710
So that is the ring finger of your left hand.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:24,320
So once again we're going to practice that for 30 seconds with each key across the middle row just like

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,730
we did with the Z.

@@@
1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,310
No for their next letter.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,390
That's the letter see.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:11,620
They see you press that key using your longest finger of your left hand which is the same letter finger

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,950
that you used to press the letter D.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:20,350
So let's use the big finger is used for the d the E above in the seat but now we're gonna practice the

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,680
C once again for thirty seconds each one at a time with each of these letters across the Middle.

@@@
1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,400
Next we're going to practice the letter V and the V.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,350
You press not using your index finger of your left hand.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,660
So that's the finger that you used to press the f the f k and also of course the archy.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,240
So once again 30 seconds each letter combination.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,880
So the V one at a time with each of these letters across the Middle.

@@@
1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:08,510
Next is the letter B and the finger that you use to press that it would be is the same finger that you

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,470
used to press the f on the middle row which is your index finger of your left hand.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,860
So once again we're gonna practice 30 seconds of time with each letter across the middle row so 30 seconds

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,450
with each letter.

@@@
1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,650
No we're going to move over to the right.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:11,340
The bottom key is the forward slash key of C C is a question mark there as well which you can get by

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,510
pressing shift for and holding shift and in doing so you're just going to refer to that as a slash K

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,920
to make it easier and simpler.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,250
So we're gonna start by practicing now 30 seconds with one other key in the middle row one at a time

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:33,500
so we're going to go from right all the way over to left this time because it's for the right hand.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,590
So practice that key for 30 seconds and the finger that you used to place on that key you may have already

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,950
guessed is your small finger on your right hand who's the same key you used to press the semicolon key.

@@@
1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,850
So the next key we're going to practice and learn is the full stop key.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,270
So the finger that you used to press the full stop key is the same finger that you used to press the

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,620
L which is your ring finger of your right hand.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,530
So once again we're going to 30 seconds at a time with each of these keys across the middle row.

@@@
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,470
The next key we're going to practice and learn is the common key the finger that used to press the common

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,680
key is the same one that you used to press the K on the middle row which is your longest finger of your

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,620
right on your right hand.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,290
So once again we're going to practice for 30 seconds a time in combination with these keys across the

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:20,560
Middle.

@@@
1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,470
The next key that we're going to practice is the letter M and the finger that you would use to press

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,570
the M is the finger that you used to press the J on the middle road and also the U above on the top

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,050
row.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,980
Not sure index finger of your right hand.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:21,440
So once again for 30 seconds a time when a practice in combination with each key on the middle row one

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,010
at a time.

@@@
1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,590
On the next key on the bottom row is the N so we use our index finger of our right hand to press the

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,990
ends.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,760
It's the same finger that used to press the J on the home key so we're gonna practice that key with

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,770
one of each of the keys across the middle one at a time for 30 seconds each.

@@@
1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,790
So we have now gone through all the bottom row or the keys on the bottom of the letters and learn which

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,800
fingers to use to press each one in practice each one for 30 seconds.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,250
So you need to continue practicing that over and over again.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:26,880
30 seconds for each double key combination until you're able to type each combination without looking

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,640
down at your keyboard and off.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,450
No I've given you a practice sheet of course that you can use this to continue practicing so you can

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,420
either print it out or if you wish you can have it on your computer so have it so that you can see it

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,360
next to your word processor.

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,990
So have the practice sheet on the left.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,230
You were a process on the right or whichever way you want it and then continue just practicing the combinations

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,640
by looking at the practice sheet without looking at your keyboard.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Keep doing that until you're eventually able to do it without looking at your keyboard at all.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,440
Now like the previous practice sheets there's three sections.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:12,570
So the first one is or the bottom keys on the left hand side so the one you use your left hand to type

15
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,000
and then the next section is the key.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,460
Bottom keys on the right hand side which is what you used to type with your right hand and then the

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,540
final section is where it's all the bottom keys in combination of two letters at a time.

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,680
So like I said practice each combination for 30 seconds each.

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,390
Just keep going over and over and over that until you're confident enough to practice all the key combinations

20
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,760
without looking down at your keyboard.

@@@
1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:09,000
So on the next section I'm going to be teaching you the numbers in the very top row of your keyboard

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,300
like we did with the letters.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,760
We're going to practice some with two numbers at a time.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,720
So 30 seconds each combination pair of numbers.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,600
That way it would become automatic for you and your bed to type the numbers a lot quicker.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:35,130
Using this practice method without looking at your keys at the end of the section on no practice then

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,740
I will be giving you the opportunity to download a practice sheet so that you can continue practicing

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,160
in the pairs of numbers until you are proficient enough to do this type any number without looking at

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,120
the keyboard.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,170
So with that let's go on to the number practice.

@@@
1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:09,620
So far our first pair number one and two together as you practice for 30 seconds back and forth like

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,940
we did when we did the letters on the keyboard.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:20,570
So of course if you haven't already guessed it the one you use the small finger of your left hand.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,090
And for the two you use your ring finger of your left hand.

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,260
So essentially using those fingers you pressed the one on the two.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,710
So you do it for 30 seconds back and forth.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,520
So you go one two one 2 and so on.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,560
Start slowly and so make sure keep it short.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,540
Make sure you keep accuracy.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,510
And then slowly build up your speed.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,690
If you start then getting the wrong keys just slow slightly reduce your speed again until you can get

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,590
back to accuracy and let your speed slowly build up from there.

13
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:01,130
Let's continue practicing just 30 seconds for this pair and then you would move on to the next pair

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,740
of letters on the next pair next parents so on and so on and then eventually you go back to the first

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,280
pair wanted to again start all over again.

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,090
Continue practicing that way.

@@@
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,490
The next number is three which will practice with one you already know which finger to use on one.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,510
That's the small finger of your left hand.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,190
The three you use the longest finger of your left hand to press that.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:21,310
So essentially the one is pressed with the finger you used to press a Q in Z the same finger the finger

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,430
that used to press decency use that to press three to once again back and forth starting slowly and

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:36,530
gradually building up speed to keep accuracy 1 3 1 3 and so on so do that next for 30 seconds and then

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,150
will do 30 seconds for the next pair of letters.

@@@
1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,570
The next pair of letters is 1 in 4.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,180
We're learning the new latch.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:05,980
No.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,680
It was a nice pair of numbers 1 and 4.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,790
So we're learning of course a new number which is 4.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,590
So 1 you know which finger to use to press one small finger of your left arm.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,120
The for you will you will you will use your index finger of your left hand to press that one so the

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,570
same thing you used to press the F and R and the.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:33,220
So once again back and forth starting slowly gradually building at the speed for 30 seconds 1 and 4.

@@@
1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,130
The next number is five.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,330
We'll practice that still with one.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,480
So one in five.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,950
The five you will use again your index finger of your left hand to press the five.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,420
So it's used for the same number.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,570
So you your index finger like you use it for F and G on the middle row.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,710
You will see the same three numbers above.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,760
Use it for the four under five.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,890
So no for the five practice one and five.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,850
Back and forth starting slowly and do that practice for thirty seconds and then do the next pair of

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,330
numbers.

@@@
1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,680
The next number to learn and practice is number six.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,980
Note the number six is you.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,680
You press that with the index finger of your right hand.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,120
So never starting to use numbers with our right hand.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,880
But the this I'm going to keep the pair of numbers all with the one so far.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,290
Don't worry you'll also practice in combination.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:34,480
The other letters other numbers together as pairs as well but that will be in the practice sheets but

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:42,950
for the purposes here is learning which finger to use to press each number in these videos.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,520
So one in six.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,020
So the one is with a small thing of the left hand.

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,370
Of course you know the six with the index finger of your right hand.

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,710
So practice for thirty seconds.

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,720
That pair of numbers.

@@@
1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,000
And the next number is number seven.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,380
Continuing to practice along with the number one as a pair.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,180
At the moment.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,710
So the seven again is your index finger of your right hand.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,840
So the index finger of your right hand essentially is used for the number six and then number seven.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,840
So we're going to practice no slowly at first and building a speed up to keep accuracy the one under

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,800
seven.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,890
Do that for 30 seconds and then we'll move on to the next pair of numbers.

@@@
1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,550
The next number is the number eight.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:10,470
So the eight you use your longest finger of your right hand.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,110
So again practicing with number one at the moment.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,190
That pair who do other pairs later on when you get your practice sheets so you get to practice all the

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,060
numbers in in a in combination.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,890
So for now we're going to just practice one and the number eight.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:37,410
So start slowly and build up your speed keeping accuracy so 1 8 1 8 on a game remember it's the longest

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,770
finger on your right hand foot the number eight.

@@@
1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,210
The next number is the number nine.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:09,620
And you may have already guessed that Bain finger that you used to press the number nine is the ring

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,850
finger of your right hand the same one you used to press the letter L and of course the oh and the full

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,650
stop below.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:27,710
So perhaps again 1 and 9 together as to number combination practice starting slowly.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,380
These two numbers for 30 seconds and then we'll move on to the last number.

@@@
1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,150
No for the zero.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,460
You will press that using your smallest finger on your right hand.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:15,690
The one that you used to press the semicolon and also the letter P and of course below the slash or

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,970
the question mark if you hold down the shift key first.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,580
So 1 and 0 so the small fingers on both hands this time so it's the smallest finger on your left hand

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,640
for the one on the smallest finger in your right hand for the 0 1 to gain 30 seconds starting slowly

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,490
and as you continue practice keeping accuracy your build up your speed as you to become faster.

@@@
1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,400
No that I've shown you which fingers to use for each of the numbers across the top.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,790
You continue your practice of using the practice sheets that you'll be able to download in the next

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,460
lecture.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,670
Those practice sheets then will get you to practice in combination.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,340
All the numbers in pairs.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:28,560
So the next one after the the 1 and 2 1 and 3 1 and 4 and so up to 0 you'll be 2 in 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 and

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,080
9 2 0.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,450
Moving on then to 3 and 4 reason we don't go 3 and 1 is because we've already done one in 3.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,240
We don't do 2 and 3 again because we've already done 2 and 3.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,180
So we just start from the 3 up to the not impaired and go 4 and 5.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,340
Because you've already done the 3 and 4 right.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,890
So back and forth 4 and 5 and so on.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,190
Going through right up to get to the 9 under 0 right at the end.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,390
So that's the practice sheets though.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,580
So in the next lecture you'll be able to download the practice sheets.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,720
So like in the previous sections in the next lecture you see the screen which will give you the link

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,570
to download the practice sheet.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,530
So just simply click on that and download and then you can use it on your computer screen side by side

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,170
be a word processor or if you prefer you can printed out.

@@@
1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,750
Going to show you the easiest way now to practice doing capital letters.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,890
You do that by pressing the shift key on your keyboard.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,790
Now also the shift key will be what you would use to access the characters which appear above another

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:24,930
character on your keyboard so if you look on the bottom right you'll see the slash key and there is

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,940
a question mark above it you get the question mark by holding down the shift key and then pressing that

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,920
key and it'll give you the question mark.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,370
So we look along with a keyboard like above the numbers.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,440
Quite a few keys have another option above them and you get that by holding and pressing down the shift

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,640
key.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,050
Now you may already know that note.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,680
Again we want to be learning how to press the shift key without actually having to look down at the

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,380
keyboard because otherwise it's going to slow us down.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,390
So there is a really easy way of doing that.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:59,090
So first we're going to get used to which fingers you press used to press the shift key so on in on

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,820
your left hand your small key.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,290
That's the one you use to press the A on the home keys.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:16,080
You slide that down to the left OK diagonally down to the left and press are onto the shift key.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,790
Similarly on the right hand side you'll produce your small finger used to press the semicolon key and

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,770
slide that down diagonally over to the right to press the shift key.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,990
OK.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,400
So that's the fingers that you would use.

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,220
But when you're not looking at the keyboard you know sliding of cost making sure you know you're actually

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,570
hitting not key.

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,400
That's where we need to practice.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,360
So this is what you would do to practice what I recommend in it's this.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,540
So as you remember in the earlier lesson we talked about how to find the home keys and that is by having

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,420
your little fingers on the F of a left hand and the play the index finger of your left hand on the FCC

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,110
your right index finger on the Jaqui and remember there was a little pump on that key so we could find

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,710
it.

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,040
So keeping an eye so essentially keep your.

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,370
So for the if you want to copy the letter on the left using your left hand.

32
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,680
So for instance if you're using your right hand to press the letter you want to be a capital you would

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,280
then use the left hand left hand to press to shift key and then your right hand to press the key.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,870
You want to be a couple of letter and vice versa.

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,780
So on the left hand you're pressing the letter to be a capital you use your right hand.

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,410
So the way I recommend that you do it.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:45,510
So if there's your left hand is to keep your index finger on top of that f key one you can feel that

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,430
little bump on it and then slide keeping your index finger on that key.

39
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,310
Slide your left finger diagonally down to the left and then hold that shift key walls.

40
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,290
So essentially your index finger or your left hand will still be touching the FCC while your little

41
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,570
finger slides across down slightly to press and hold down the shift key and then your right hand to

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,190
use to press the cover letter.

43
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,070
That's what I recommend.

44
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:21,840
That way you're not going to move in your whole hand down onto the bottom keys because then you it's

45
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,110
going to slow you down going back moving your hand back up to find the home keys again and find the

46
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,940
FCC.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,230
So keep your index finger on the f key the whole time as you press that shift key.

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,530
Similarly with the right hand the same thing keep your index finger your right times on the J.

49
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,510
The whole time so your little fingers over the semicolon.

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,700
So keeping your index finger on the J slide it down diagonally to the right and that will give you the

51
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,270
shift key so that then you can hold that down and press the letter with your left hand to get the capital

52
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,480
letter there.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,080
So how to practice it.

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,190
So here's the way it's really very simple.

55
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,480
So could you say all right practice lots of text with capital letters at the start.

56
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,290
Yeah you can learn it that way.

57
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,550
I mean obviously you will be doing that as well but as you progressed however to practice learning the

58
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,060
shift key it's a really simple two step method.

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,370
All right.

60
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,750
So again remembering to keep your index fingers on the F and the J key with your left.

61
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,310
And of course one on your right hand you then practice using your little finger moving across whilst

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,210
keeping your index fingers on those keys as you get the shift key.

63
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,590
You're going to do that back and forth.

64
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,370
So essentially you would just simply slide your left finger first diagonally down and present hold the

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:56,700
shift key and then slide it back up to the A again and then do the same with the right hand slide that

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,390
finger there whilst keeping your index finger on the Jaqui on the shift key.

67
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,300
Hold that.

68
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,960
And then back up again.

69
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,740
And it's simply a case of just doing that over and over again.

70
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,120
And then you will learn the shift key.

@@@
1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,300
You may have noticed that so far I've not mentioned a particular key on the keyboard.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,190
The big long one at the bottom of the keyboard the spacebar.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,540
There is a reason for that because you don't really need to practice that one to be able to press the

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,550
spacebar without looking at the keyboard because you know you will have your thumbs on top of that key

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,290
the whole time that you're actually typing.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,950
So it'd just be a case of pressing your thumb down whether she left or your right thumb OK depend on

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,640
what letter that you press.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,090
So it doesn't really require me to give you some drills trying to practice that but you know when you

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,420
come to practice actual text typing text you an elbow and there's a space between a word at the end

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:55,580
of a sentence or whatever it is you simply press the spacebar down also to give you a new paragraph

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,490
the key on the right there the enter key dependent where it is on your keyboard usually on the right

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,180
to get a new paragraph or a new line should I say on the word processor.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,400
I mean you may have to maybe look at a keyboard the first few times but you know that it's over to the

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,980
right from your small little finger.

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:23,050
So again when you start practicing tax actual text and moving down to paragraphs typing paragraphs moving

16
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,080
to new lines you after awhile get used to that as well pressing the enter key.

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,650
So I didn't really think it was a requirement to give you actually practice drills to learn those because

18
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,230
when you come to type in text they refer to easy So remember you know when you put your fingers on those

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,910
on the home keys or the SDF or the left hand the J K L and the same school on fair right on your two

20
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,780
thumbs will naturally rest on top of the spacebar.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,440
So that's really all I need to tell you about the spacebar.

22
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,770
And of course I did mention the enter key as well.

@@@
1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:09,710
I'm going to show you a very simple method, and it's what I use to massively increase my typing speed.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,780
And in fact, when I started to record my speeds, I was recording speeds of around 180 words and sometimes

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,090
more than 200 words a minute.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,480
So when I first started typing, learning to type, I didn't use any typing manuals, you know, any

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,120
of those typing tutor things used to get news like spiral bound books, you know, the sort where they

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,170
give you exercises.

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,600
And I did it so you could say this or the hard way.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,470
And I was actually doing a course on computers, you know, basic computing.

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,590
So they were showing you about spreadsheets, word processors, database and so on.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,760
So when I was doing the purpose, of course, it involved typing.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,680
And so I thought, oh, you know, I'm going to increase my typing speed and I'll learn to touch type

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,460
so I can type without looking at my fingers.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,230
So at the center, they had one of these they're called copy holders.

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:09,730
And I used that to put a book or some text on my eye, then would look at the text and attempt to type

15
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,290
it on the computer screen.

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,370
You know, the copy holder was not exactly this one, like this one here on Amazon, but it was something

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,700
like, you know, you could stand it next to your computer and put the text on.

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,370
And I just used to have that next to me.

19
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,280
And I just get different passages of text.

20
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:34,010
And although slowly at first, you know, learning where the keys were on the keyboard so I could find

21
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,440
them with my fingers without looking at the keyboard, which I did a lot at the start.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,320
But eventually I was able to type all the keys.

23
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,440
And so I just kept getting new passages of text and going through it and through it and through and,

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,280
you know, slowly but surely I did actually start to increase my speech, in fact.

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,670
But, you know, after a while I thought, you know, I want to increase my speed more.

26
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,490
So I thought, oh, I know what I'll do.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,880
And so what I did is I decided to copy the same piece of text over and over and over again.

28
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,880
And I found that each time through that I kept typing through the text.

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,950
I got faster and faster.

30
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,300
So essentially, you know, I just thought, I want to keep typing this text until I can type it as

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,110
fast as possible.

32
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,200
And so fast I got now, I didn't actually have a way of recording my typing speed, but I know I was

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,780
very quick at doing it and then I would just get another passage of text and then do the same thing

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,130
with that, keep repeating it and repeating it until I got fairly quick at typing that.

35
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,910
No, later on I decided to do this at home as well when I got my own computer because I didn't actually

36
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,740
have a computer at the time and I took this course.

37
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,720
It's more for me to help me get a job.

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,880
But later on I got a computer at home and I didn't get a computer like this.

39
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,850
Instead, what I did was get some text on my screen and my word processor on the screen at the same

40
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,800
time and then start typing that way.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,810
So, you know, it looked a little bit like this.

42
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,020
You know, I have to resize the word processor like I've got here on the right.

43
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,410
And then I'd have, as in this case, my Kindle.

44
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,570
I've got a Kindle book open with some text there so I could just simply go here and start typing the

45
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,360
text that appeared over here on the left.

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,050
So I would do that later on.

47
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,840
I thought, you know, I want to find out how fast I want to be able to measure my typing speed.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,850
So searched on the Internet for typing tutor software, that sort of thing.

49
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,740
And I could look around.

50
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,220
I can't remember what it was called and I haven't got any more, but found one.

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,940
And I downloaded to my computer and this thing was, you know, had loaded with different words, typing

52
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,160
exercises and things like that.

53
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,580
But one of the things I liked about it is that you could copy and paste text into it.

54
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,130
Everything you thought was what didn't allow me to copy the length of text that I was practicing over

55
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,960
and over again before it.

56
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,770
Just let us copy a small amount of text in a time.

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,470
But the beauty of it is I could type the text and then the software.

58
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,880
It actually would tell me what my words per minute typing speed was.

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,230
And I actually learned something from this because I just decided to copy a paragraph in at a time and

60
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,450
just practiced a paragraph over and over again.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,710
What I noticed then my speed increased even more.

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,790
It really did a lot more than what it did whilst I was typing longer section passages of text.

63
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,630
So typing the paragraph over and over again, a shorter piece of text.

64
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,140
My speed improved even more.

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,580
And this is where I discovered that my typing speeds were quite often around 180 words a minute.

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,470
And sometimes I surprised myself in the fact that it went even over 200 words a minute.

67
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,290
In fact, it was quite good seeing the progress.

68
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,400
So the this is the method.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,670
You know, the way to increase your typing speed is to type passages of text, ideally short passages,

70
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,230
paragraphs or something like that.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,640
Over and over again.

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,430
You will notice that your typing speed will increase if you continue to do this.

@@@
1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,750
Well, I'm not going to share something with you which will allow you to get faster, but without making

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,620
lots of mistakes.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,730
So when I was typing, I had this idea that to get faster, you just got to simply try to type faster.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,960
So that's what I did.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,190
I was typing my texts and as I was telling you in the last video, and I thought, well, I'm going

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,710
to just push myself to go faster and faster and faster.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,520
And even though it seemed that my typing speed not, I was kept tripping myself up making mistakes.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,480
But I, I just thought and said, well, OK, I just keep trying to write faster and eventually those

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,440
mistakes will go.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,980
In actual fact, quite the opposite, because when you practice making a mistake, you just get better

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,700
at making mistakes and that's not really what you want.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,490
So the better way to do it is what I tried next was instead of trying to just type faster, just keep

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:04,860
it accurate, don't try too slowly, but just type a fast enough speed where you're not making mistakes

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,480
and just keep doing that.

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,940
And it's like riding a bike.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,000
You know, when you first jump on a bike, you don't try to go as fast as you can.

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,790
You first get used to keeping the bike upright, keeping on the bike, and then slowly, as your confidence

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,160
increases, turning the pedals, you then become more confident and your speed naturally increases.

19
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,680
And so that's what I found when I did that with my typing.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,280
So what I did was I typed the text I was doing copy it, called me my text as I was doing there, and

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,570
I just did it at a speed where I was not making mistakes or shall we say as little as a few mistakes

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,200
as possible.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,970
So lesson I want you to take from this is focus on the accuracy more than the speed.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,190
Try to make sure that you're accurately typing words, keep your typing free of mistakes, and then

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:05,670
the speed you will find will come naturally as you get more confident your typing ability.

@@@
1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:08,130
So you have no learned all the keys and hope for you been practicing all the keys so that you're able

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,310
to learn how to type.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,380
No you better type.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,590
Every single key on your keyboard without actually having to look down at it.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:28,180
OK so just keep up the practice remember the drills 30 seconds each pair using your practice sheet.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,410
Keep doing that daily until you're proficient.

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,340
Keep slowly.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,290
Don't make mistakes only increase your speed gradually.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,310
So eventually you will the more you do it the easier it will get and the faster you will get as well.

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,180
So do do all the pairs.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,850
Believe me this is the way the fastest way to learn how to touch type and be faster on the keyboard.

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,620
Now with that continued practice.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:03,050
So what I would suggest that you do as well as this now is to practice actually typing real text.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,650
So simply just get you know passages of text or whatever item next to your computer or on your computer.

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,400
Next here you have the text on one side and your post word process on the next.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,670
Just practice typing texts again.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,130
You know my advice is slowly at first types slowly make sure its accuracy keep accuracy.

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,140
And then slowly build the speed up.

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,640
Otherwise you try to go too quickly first and you're making mistakes.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,380
We are eventually going to be practicing mistakes and you'll just be harder than to learn to get rid

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,330
of your mistakes.

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,330
So keep slowly.

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:47,310
Just continue practicing text passages of text as often as you possibly can and you will find your speed

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,190
will get faster and faster and faster.

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,100
And that's what I did to learn typing myself.

26
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:03,310
Now I sincerely hope that you have enjoyed this course but more than not that you will be a much faster

27
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,630
typist to be more productive as a result.

28
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,550
However you know if there's any feedback about the course if there's anything that you would like to

29
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:19,770
be included that I've not included then you know do let me know so I can make improvements.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,110
Now if you want to ask me any questions whatsoever.

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,790
And here is a Q and A section.

32
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,920
You just simply click on Q and A.

33
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,580
Well that's what it looks like at the moment unless you to me have now changed it.

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,880
But here's a Q and A and just simply out and you.

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,360
QUESTION No I will get back to you.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,830
It may not be straight away or maybe sometimes not the same day because sometimes there's other things

37
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,980
I do but you know I I will definitely come back to you if you leave a question there.

38
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,610
I'll get back to you as soon as I possibly can because I really want you to help out sorry.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,990
And again I truly want to help you.

40
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,240
OK so that's great.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,180
I also really appreciate it as well.

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,840
If you've enjoyed the course you know be lovely if you could just leave a few words in any review so

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,540
thank you very much for taking this course.
