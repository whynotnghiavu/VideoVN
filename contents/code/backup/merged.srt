‫Hello and welcome. ‫Thank you very much us for enrolling in this course. ‫I hope you will benefit from this course very much, and I am very excited about our journey forward, ‫journey forward.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:37,110
‫So I have devoted this course in several section. ‫The first section we will contain this introduction video only in the second section we will discuss ‫over some basic things like that, proper positioning, how that task typing AAPS, how group practice ‫more effectively.

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:51,420
‫And at the third section, will you and who are practicing? ‫We will start griping by their test typing method. ‫First we learned their task typing of all the letters from it to J.

4
00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:03,570
‫Then we will go further to the numerical gives special characters and the number pad. ‫We will follow more liberal methods of practicing to get the most out of discourse.

5
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:22,920
‫The final section is about the shortcut. ‫Yes, we will learn a word, some super useful shortcut keys that ox almost every hired. ‫These keyboard shortcuts will help us to boost our productivity by saving their time we do in the mouse ‫and the keyboard.

00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:21,560
‫Let's discuss the method of piping. ‫There are two methods of piping. ‫The first one is fast typing. ‫Who is? ‫We are going to learn in discourse in this method on Berson can type without looking at the keyboard ‫or without even thinking about the positions of the keys.

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:33,670
‫The second method is hand and big typing. ‫If you don't know pass typing, then you may be following this method. ‫I used to do that a few years back.

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:48,370
‫Most of the people usually use two fingers to type in this method there. ‫So it also called the cool finger method. ‫You will need to look at the keyboard whose has the location of the key.

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:01:06,370
‫Then you need to proceed first hand, then base anyway. ‫In this hard and fixed method, your speed will be a maximum of 30 hours per minute. ‫Of course, it will have some exceptions.

5
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:28,930
‫Some may be able to type faster than that, but it is rare. ‫However, in dust typing you can get a speed up. ‫Up to 100 endures by minute. ‫So if you type tidiest per minute, then a 300 or email will take you 10 minutes to write.

6
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:43,450
‫But if you can type guys as fast, that means at 60 hours per minute, which is pretty easy to achieve ‫in does typing, then you can write the email in five minutes.

7
00:01:44,500 --> 00:02:13,380
‫There's a lot of money saved if you write a lot of emails. ‫But other than the fact that it increases the speed of typing, I think the most important aspect is ‫that you would not need to think about the case high typing so you can dynamically put your tarps down ‫as they come to you, just like you do when you write by hand.

8
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:26,970
‫It will definitely help you to think effectively because of the lives distraction. ‫If you are a blogger or a programmer, it can be a great skill to increase your productivity and efficiency.

00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:15,290
‫Attorney, they're stepping through muscle memory. ‫It develops through repetition. ‫When you do the same model task again and again, it gets to blend into your memory.

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:29,150
‫That muscle memory is long gone. ‫So if you can develop muscle memory, you're not going to forget it anytime soon. ‫But at first, it would not be easy to get muscle memory.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:42,620
‫It will be challenging. ‫Mark, eventually with depredations, you will be able to perform that test with little or no conscious ‫effort. ‫It will happen spontaneously.

4
00:00:43,340 --> 00:01:01,620
‫You don't have to give attention to that task at that time. ‫Take bicycle riding as an example. ‫Riding a bicycle walks through the muscle memory. ‫It takes some time and practice to learn to ride the bicycle for the first time.

5
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:15,190
‫But also, you have learned it. ‫You are not going to forget it. ‫I had learned to ride a bicycle when I was seven. ‫After a few years, my bicycle goddamnedest.

6
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:29,700
‫So I didn't have ride a bicycle for five to six years later that year. ‫I went on a bicycle ride with my friends. ‫At first it felt a little weird and I was uncomfortable.

7
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:42,950
‫Mark, we did a few minutes. ‫I could just write perfectly. ‫And as I have already said, learning does, typing and riding the bicycle is almost the same.

8
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:56,810
‫They both are the same. ‫A through muscle memory. ‫It is some effort and practice to learn it. ‫But when you develop days skill, you can use it your whole life.

9
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:10,800
‫And while practicing, eventually, it will get easier to do till it gets completely effortless. ‫So the entire census of this course will depend on your practicing.

10
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:27,380
‫If you don't practice enough, no matter how hard they try, it will not. ‫So my request will be back this everyday. ‫Give some time to develop this skill, and within a few days, it will be easy.

1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:16,140
‫We need to fix her posture before we start learning. ‫That's typing. ‫Otherwise, it only easy to get the most out copy from our practicing. ‫And also, you may suffer from back pain and wrist pain.

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:32,020
‫Although some of us used to sit like this and like this guy also. ‫Honestly, I do this sometimes. ‫There are so many rules and regulations about how to sit on the chair properly.

3
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:47,710
‫But we are not going to follow all of this because we don't need to do that. ‫However, there are some essential rules that we will follow because if we don't, that will affect ‫our learning process.

4
00:00:48,650 --> 00:01:01,880
‫So let's talk about some of those rules. ‫We need to follow while practicing their typing, this is the ideal position for setting that angle ‫between your back and your leg.

5
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:30,660
‫Should be around 100 degrees. ‫Although you can win back a little like this guy, but not like this guy here. ‫They're top of their skin and your eye should be on the same horizontal plane, your eyes should be ‫able to view their skin comfortably without having to a jet plane or turn your neck or your eyes.

6
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:45,730
‫The most important part is the position of the hand while sitting the height of the desk should be slightly ‫lower than the hand level. ‫Your palm of the hand should not touch anything.

7
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:59,360
‫It should be hanging on the air like the first picture, he raised taxes their desk. ‫It wouldn't be comfortable to pass type. ‫So this is it for this later.

00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:17,220
‫If he was her son online, you will get multiple calls, both online and offline group practice that's ‫typing, all of them has some advantages and disadvantages over others in this lecture.

2
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:40,660
‫We are going to use a tool named Kipton. ‫They deal with I double P and then. ‫So this is the tool. ‫And you can download it or you can practice online for discourse.

3
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:54,140
‫I am going to download it here. ‫You can find this hot-air passion. ‫It is available for Windows, Linux or Mac. ‫So click here, download now for free.

4
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:09,170
‫The first one is for Windows. ‫Second one is also following those, but it is portable Caledonius for Mac OS and Forten is for Windows ‫and the last one is for Linux.

5
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:26,580
‫So you can download it travelling to your device you are using. ‫I'm on a nice machine, so I'm going to use the windows. ‫So let's click it here. ‫You can also download the portable on if you like.

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:45,290
‫So it downloads automatically and here we need to install it now. ‫No SoBe minute by clicking it paran the langurs will be English. ‫Ah, if you want to learn German you can also click that part.

7
00:01:45,590 --> 00:02:05,560
‫In this course we are going to learn English typing. ‫So let's click. ‫OK ‫then click. ‫They said the agreement. ‫I'm going to take this because I own this desktop icon and in St..

8
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:22,320
‫So this is the day stop and that app that is created here is just click it and open it. ‫So this is where you come, this plan if you don't want to see it.

9
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:34,010
‫You can just click this. ‫So in that way, you will not ever see this again. ‫And head this is showing the home games. ‫And here some games seem to follow.

10
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:48,220
‫So I'm going to adjust to Landstar app and head. ‫It is. ‫You can also maximizers and in the next day. ‫We are going to learn what the settings of this app.


@@@
1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:13,120
‫Now, let's talk about the settings and user interface of this app named Deep Tim. ‫So at the left side, there are some lessors is less on Gardane, some characters.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:27,470
‫And we are going to learn these characters in that particular Lissa's. ‫So let's go to the first lesson, which is the home key lessons. ‫Just click the start training button and the right bottom corner.

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:42,170
‫And here is this. ‫We need to press the Espers bar to start the typing, and in here there is a demarcation line between ‫the keyboard quizzes dividing the keyboard into two 1/2.

4
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:57,880
‫The lid part of this line will be tied by left hand, and the right part of this line will be typed ‫by right hand. ‫And as you can see here, this is D and F and also anti gay.

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:11,840
‫And this typing has a color about them. ‫So this at the home, kiss your little finger up your left hand should be able to a then 13 finger will ‫be able.

6
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:23,690
‫Is middle finger will be. ‫It will be. ‫And index finger will be able if same applied to take a L and the semicolon in this of the right hand ‫will be on the G.

7
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:35,720
‫The next turn will be on K then in and in say Ricola here. ‫Both Tom will be able. ‫This was back at the bottom that is showing some instruction ratios take home rule position.

8
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:51,500
‫That means you need to position the hands properly. ‫Then if I praise the spacebar by the time. ‫Now Haridas and at the top, the characters we are going to type is showing and the respective character ‫is being highlighted on the keyboard.

9
00:01:51,650 --> 00:02:03,580
‫Now it is it has a background color now and at the instruction bar it is showing his finger to use. ‫So it is nurturing left little finger so that it will be tight.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:20,130
‫My left little finger. ‫Then the next turn. ‫Next drawn and also space take in like that. ‫And if you do any mistake in this typing process, you do not get forward until when we pressed the ‫right key.

11
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:32,370
‫It will hold. ‫Now only because the right key. ‫It will go for. ‫You can also posit are when they're typewriting will be finished. ‫It will say adolescence.

12
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,520
‫And if you're on to a zit, listeners are. ‫It will as to be sheer. ‫And then if you're on the set, the reserves are not. ‫So if you want to say click.

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:50,550
‫Yes. ‫Otherwise, no, no. ‫At the right sage, you can select the duration of the list. ‫I'll see you on practice so you can either select their time limit.

14
00:02:50,610 --> 00:03:01,530
‫The minimum time limit will be two minutes and you can also say that character limit. ‫So when the character limits will be X's, this on the lesson will be finished.

15
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:18,860
‫Also, it has a minimum limit up to her neck. ‫Characters. ‫And at the right more time, it considered their response to typing ITRs. ‫We had seen that when we make a mistake, it holds until we type that Korecki.

16
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:31,250
‫But if you take this one correction with backspace, then it will not hold. ‫You need to press makerspace part on them close to the taste. ‫And garroted hard for the beginners.

17
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:42,670
‫You to not have selected this because it will make this process harder. ‫You can also select Darlie will signal. ‫And if you made any typing either it will make us sound in there.

18
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:56,910
‫I say there is some eston options. ‫So now we have seen that keyboard was showing itself. ‫So if you just take this, you do not show it anymore. ‫So for beginners, I think it will be better to show the keyboard.

19
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:12,360
‫And this Clarkie will highlight the respective backgrounds in the two parts. ‫The second often is for home rule. ‫I have seen that the homework is has a line of color iwobi and that fourth option is for left and right.

20
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:25,280
‫Separation line and perhaps in the instruction at the bottom. ‫So if you just take this, my instruction will not show it anymore. ‫So writing this header is a bar for a beginner.

21
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:36,060
‫When you are going to be disbarred or get used to the keyboard or bass typing, you can take this all ‫in here. ‫There is this file and general settings.

22
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:45,790
‫You can change the font color and the background. ‫And the second option is cool. ‫You can see your Riza's here, so I haven't done any practice dissociate.

23
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:58,490
‫So if you do, you can see defined lessons and their time need action, time, duration characters. ‫And Edo's who is fingers has the most of the euro's rate and character per minute.

24
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:09,650
‫You can also see the progress of lessons as a graph in here. ‫You can also see whose characters made most mistake or errors and what is the frequency.

25
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:20,710
‫And these fingers make the most of the mistakes. ‫We also have a comparison table here in this settings. ‫You can see your progress over times. ‫So this is it for this lecture.

1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:21,610
‫In this letter, I have got some important points that you need to remember while practicing. ‫So the first step is. ‫Always place your fingers in the home position and after placing a key of another rule or defined position.

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:35,290
‫Make sure that your fingers return back to the home position. ‫It is very important, especially when you are just starting out. ‫It will be very difficult to do that, but you have to do that anyway.

3
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:52,390
‫You need to unlearn everything you have been doing. ‫I was typing before, the second point is ever heard. ‫Looking at the keyboard. ‫At first, you will have the desire to look at the keyboard while pressing a key, but don't do that.

4
00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:07,470
‫Don't look at the keyboard, gives the position of the key. ‫Then proceed to appear strong. ‫Then do that again until you called the right key. ‫Keeping their fingers in home position will help you to do that.

5
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:28,220
‫That if and Zaky has a slight impression on it, you can feel it by touching both both your index finger ‫on those keys. ‫It will help you to keep your fingers in Homero position and most importantly, ignore their desire ‫to look down at the keyboard.

6
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:45,440
‫Always look at the monitor. ‫The heartburn is Gabe importance on accuracy rather than is paid while you are just starting out. ‫Gone crash to die faster, it will happen automatically.

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:02:04,110
‫Just try to do it slowly and keep your ears in a minimum with times you can in case they speed up your ‫typing. ‫And even if you are in a hurry and you haven't learned typing properly yet.

8
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:17,400
‫On. ‫We've heard back to the way you used to type. ‫Take your time and do it by duct taping. ‫Otherwise, it will affect your muscle memory and we don't want that to happen.

9
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:34,330
‫Almost try to remain relaxed while practicing. ‫Keep your shoulder and hand muscles relaxed. ‫Try to practice at the appropriate time. ‫You can practice after just waking up at the time.

10
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:51,760
‫The brain will be relaxed. ‫Keep your practice sessions chart and take pick between your practice sessions. ‫If you follow these rules, I think it will be benefited Pyramus and within a week you will be able ‫to type without looking at the keyboard.

1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:12,780
‫Hello and welcome to this complete new lecture. ‫And from this later, we are going to start our practicing process in this lecture. ‫We are going to go about our home kiss.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:30,610
‫There are eight home guests total for live 10. ‫It will be A is D and F, and for the right hand, it will be G, K, L and the semicolon. ‫So your left little finger will be on the letter A..

3
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:47,980
‫The ring finger will be on. ‫Is the middle finger will be on. ‫B an index finger will be on. ‫If this if he has a slight impatient on that. ‫And according to this you can position your fingers perfectly on the home key.

4
00:00:49,340 --> 00:01:11,000
‫And because of the right side of this keyboard. ‫That Takeyh has a slight impression on it. ‫So you can put your index finger up your right hand on the day and the next finger collectively on gay ‫IL and the semicolon, your bull, Tom, will be on the Espers bar.

5
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:32,470
‫Now, as we have already learned about the homegirls, let's go to the practicing. ‫So this is our Teplin app. ‫I am going to open that. ‫Lance stepped in and now we are going to finish this lesson on so let's select the listen on, then ‫click the start training.

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:48,510
‫And this is it. ‫So at first you need to put your hand in the home position. ‫Let's do that and then press the experts. ‫But you don't need to move any of your fingers because this is the home case.

7
00:01:48,590 --> 00:02:06,230
‫So you just need to press the respective case without moving your fingers. ‫And this lesson is very important because if you don't know the home case properly, then it will be ‫very difficult for you to practice either case.

8
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:26,220
‫So let's say I started practicing. ‫As you can see here, you can see their respective highlighted case. ‫And it took place. ‫And if you make any laws like that, you do not move forward.

9
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:42,150
‫So in the top is the right key. ‫Then move on to the next. ‫Like, when you have finished practicing medicine, it will automatically exists and you can see there ‫is ours in here.

10
00:02:43,730 --> 00:03:00,350
‫Mark, I'm not going to complete all the lessons if I do that, it will be very lonely. ‫So when you are just starting. ‫I prefer to keep this time limit to five minutes or you can also keep that character limit yourself ‫five Nick and others.

11
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:17,930
‫Keep in mind that you need to focus on that accuracy. ‫So don't make Koumas Edo's at first. ‫It will be slightly slow. ‫You need to remember wisky are on his fingers, but it will be okay over times.

12
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:39,940
‫When you finish on lesson, there would been take sign in this arrow here. ‫So if you practiced five times a day, five days. ‫So you need to practice at least five times, either using five minutes or 500 characters to move on ‫to the next lecture when you will be enough confident about this home Rose.

13
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:49,050
‫Then you can move on to the next letter. ‫But before that. ‫Keep practicing. ‫So best of luck, guys. ‫Keep practicing. ‫And see you in the next lecture.

1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:14,240
‫Hello, guys. ‫Welcome. ‫So how old are. ‫Practicing of the home kids? ‫Honestly, I have tried ons using 200 characters. ‫And this is that is art. ‫I've got 43 points.

2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:31,630
‫They split us 200 builds character per minute, and there was five typing errors so that it'll take ‫us two percent. ‫I'm sure that many of you have got more points and less heroes by practicing.

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:50,970
‫So please put your points in their discussion section below the letter so you can compare each other ‫and it will be real fun. ‫So let's move on to the next two characters who each R, E and all their Skellig this and click start ‫training.

4
00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:11,110
‫This is it, the E and or key are the envelope rule of the home case in we to use your left middle finger ‫to press E and writing finger to place or the other fingers will remain on the home positions.

5
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:27,130
‫Just extend the right ring finger to reach or. ‫And extend your left middle finger to this e the other kids who remain in the same position, do not ‫move them.

6
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:42,170
‫And in case up deep down is listen will contain everything of the previous lessons, so it will be great ‫because in that way you can revise your previous lessons.

7
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:54,830
‫And the more you go to the bottom of this practice list, the more you will get used to that task typing. ‫So let's practice and practice as a minimum of five times.


@@@
1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:19,140
‫Hello and welcome. ‫So how was your practice in the previous lesson? ‫I applied to it to our new characters. ‫And this is my result. ‫I scored 17 points at typing speed out on written down character by minute with two typing errors.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:35,590
‫Don't forget to put your points in the discussion section so you can compare with each other. ‫Now, let's move on to the next lesson. ‫And in this lesson, we are going to cover the and I.

3
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:56,040
‫So this is the hard lesson. ‫Let's start their training. ‫And this is it. ‫So in case up D, you need to extend your index finger up your left hand in a slightly angled direction.

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:11,160
‫It is not just Apple the F key. ‫So you need to just push a little bit too tightly. ‫And in case of pie, you need to use your right middle finger. ‫So it is just type of dough.

‫Okay, so it will be easy. ‫So while practicing, you can pronounce that character loud. ‫If you can are otherwise you can pronounce it silently, then press the key.

00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:27,450
‫Hello, guys, welcome to this new letter. ‫So how is your practice going so far? ‫I hope you all are doing great. ‫So in this lecture, we are going to go over to new leaders who are in and are so let's to start their ‫training that both leaders in an hour will be typed using the index finger of our both hand.

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:42,630
‫So it gives up. ‫We are going to use the index finger of left hand and it gives up in we are going to use the index finger ‫of our right hand. ‫So this is the composition of the index finger of the left hand.

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:56,550
‫And it will be extend to the top like this. ‫And that is the. ‫And it gives up. ‫In this is the composition of the index finger of the right hand. ‫And it will be came down.

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:11,610
‫And is the end. ‫So let's get started. ‫This is the spacebar to start. ‫Now we can stretch our typing for. ‫We are going to extend our index finger at the top.

5
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:22,380
‫Then press that. ‫Then it will be the normal home key position. ‫Then that in in goes up and take your index finger slightly below. ‫And it will lose the aim.

6
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:43,640
‫And press it then. ‫Is this again home position. ‫And then again in. ‫By using the index finger of your right hand. ‫So let's practice for either 500 characters are four or five minutes for more than five times before ‫moving on to the next lecture.

00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:16,860
‫Hello and welcome to this newsletter. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to go over to defend letters who serve A's and see. ‫So this is our fit lessons and this is tied to Jay.

2
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:30,320
‫In case of is, we are going to use the index finger of our right hand. ‫It is going to be pretty easy because the ace key is located on the home rule.

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:48,990
‫So we just need to push down the index finger to the left and it will be the ace key. ‫And in case of the sea, it is going to be very difficult because we are going to use the middle finger ‫of the left hand for that.

4
00:00:50,010 --> 00:01:02,310
‫And C is located just below there D. ‫So you need to push down your middle finger of your left hand a slide bit. ‫And it will be C. ‫So let's get it started.

5
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:17,880
‫This is Despres were. ‫And here are. ‫So from the home position of the middle finger of the left hand. ‫Let's get a little bit below. ‫And here's the C 10.

6
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:32,340
‫In case of Ace. ‫Take your index finger of the right hand to the left side. ‫And it is the ace. ‫Then I will be just like previous. ‫And again, see Ace.

7
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:52,960
‫And I. ‫So this is it for the lecture and practice at least five times before you move on to the next character's. ‫And don't forget to share your points in the decision section below.

00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:18,290
‫Hello and welcome. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to learn some new things like capitalization. ‫Until this later, we only have typed in two small caps, letters, Mark, from this letter.

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:32,500
‫We are going to type put a small case and uppercase letters. ‫So this is terror training. ‫And in case of capitalization, we are going to use the shift.

3
00:00:34,270 --> 00:01:04,650
‫So when we are going to type any data by using Type 10, we are going to press the right chip by the ‫pinky finger of the right hand. ‫And when we are going to type any letters by using right hand, then we are going to base the live shaped ‫by the pinky finger of left hand.

4
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:19,940
‫So it will be a vice versa. ‫This is the first word to start. ‫And. ‫We are going to hope the tea by our right hand. ‫So we are going to press the left.

5
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:36,340
‫Shaped by the left little finger. ‫At first, less because the shaped by left little finger than peasants. ‫And in case of if we are going to use the index finger of the left hand.

6
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:57,430
‫So we need to appease the right Chimpsky by their right pinky finger. ‫Just because the right shift first then says that if by using your left index, then in case, okay, ‫it will be left pinky finger and like that.

7
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:15,490
‫So is the shape first by the opposite hand. ‫Then there is the key. ‫It will be confusing at first. ‫And you really feel uncomfortable with it, but it will get used to the times.

8
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:29,260
‫And this is actually a big point in your typing lessons because it is going to be pretty difficult to ‫type in uppercase and piercing the ship. ‫At first you will get confused.

9
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:44,260
‫Who is shape to press? ‫So practice more than 10 times in this lecture until you get comfortable with the shape. ‫Tender kiss. ‫Don't move on to the next lecture.

10
00:02:45,770 --> 00:03:00,790
‫Now the residual with stuff in their nest. ‫So be careful over that. ‫Finish this later completely. ‫Practice an hour to get comfortable with the capitalization process, then move on to the next lecture.


@@@
1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:12,570
‫Hello, guys, welcome to this new letter. ‫So how does it go with the capitalization process? ‫I think it is pretty difficult, but try to get it done.

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:26,770
‫And please don't follow this letter until you have enough comfortable with the capitalization. ‫Otherwise, it won't be easy to continue their next paychecks.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:54,290
‫So in this letter, we have been took over w both capital and Lorqess and full stop and comma. ‫So let's start the training. ‫But the full list and the Omar will be praised by right hand because of karma.

4
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:08,050
‫It will be the middle finger of the right hand. ‫And in case of Philistine, we deal with the ring finger up your right hand. ‫And both us hesitate. ‫Just the rule below to the home rule.

5
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:27,620
‫So let's start by pressing spacebar. ‫And Haria at first is the right chip key then is DeBlois by your left hand. ‫Then be a little. ‫And now the comma hot there.

6
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:40,130
‫Just use your middle finger of the right hand. ‫Just put it down a little bit and you will get the comma and press it. ‫Then again, Espers Bar and other Ratz.

7
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:56,980
‫Then the fullest up comes further. ‫You need to use the ring finger upper right hand. ‫Also move your thinking air-to-air littered with relo. ‫And this is the fullest up like that.

8
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:13,680
‫So practice work five to 10 times to get comfortable with the capitalization process more. ‫And also with the fullest hope and the karma. ‫So we'll see you in the next lecture.

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:14,400
‫Hello and welcome, everyone, to this new letter. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to learn their test typing of three characters who is A, C, B, ‫and you?

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:31,410
‫Although, as you can see here, there are in two separate lessons. ‫But we are going to do it in a lecture anyway because we need to go fast. ‫If we are to learn that as typing within a week.

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:48,750
‫So let's first get started with Daddy and I'm going to start the lessons. ‫By clicking start training. ‫And here we're actually in custody. ‫It is pretty easy.

4
00:00:49,670 --> 00:01:04,910
‫We are going to use the index finger, upper left hand to preserve the downhome position of the index ‫finger of the left hand is F and the G is situated just at the right side.

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:20,310
‫So you need to just. ‫Here in this finger to the right a little bit. ‫And the next key you found is that he. ‫So it is going to be pretty easy for me.

6
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:59,190
‫So let's get started. ‫So this is the. ‫You need to just move on your index finger. ‫Right. ‫A little bit. ‫And you got to t like that. ‫So you need to act is this particular lessons at least five times to move on to the next lesson, which ‫is B and you.

7
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:13,060
‫But I'm going to exit this this unsane area. ‫And I'm going to start the training of the lessons line, which is the. ‫And, you know, their system, their training.

8
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:31,850
‫And Haria. ‫And in this lessons, it will be B and you, both of the characters will be tied by index finger of ‫our both hands. ‫That B will be typed by the index finger of the left hand.

9
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:46,210
‫And it will be typed by the index finger of the right hand. ‫You can type you pretty easily because it is inserted just about Turkey of G, which is the home key ‫of index finger up the right hand.

10
00:02:47,210 --> 00:03:07,700
‫But it gives a B it will be pretty difficult since it has a distance from the home killed in this finger ‫of the left hand, which is if so, you need to move your index finger up the left hand a little bit, ‫then to the right and it will get the B and it gives up you.

11
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:21,440
‫It is just too easy. ‫Move your index finger of the right hand to the just directly upper Barton of the Jaqui or honkey and ‫it will get you. ‫So let's practice.

12
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:42,590
‫Fact is, at least five times before moving to the mess later. ‫And I hope you already have get used to it, this capitalization process. ‫If you don't, then you need to go back to that capitalization lecture and practice, then again and ‫again until you get familiar with it.

13
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:55,960
‫But I'm sure most of you are trying to parse the shift key with only on hand. ‫And every time my gonna do that, I always put the ship with the opposite key.

1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:12,280
‫Hello and welcome to this new letter. ‫And in this letter, we are going to learn that Tarsa typing of. ‫Two new characters. ‫Who is there? ‫I am, I am.

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:31,480
‫So let's start their journey. ‫Both Dilators I and M are tied by the index finger up your right hand. ‫The home position of your index finger of the right hand is.

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:49,680
‫And he nodded, copious eye. ‫You need to go up and then slightly to the left. ‫And you release the key eye. ‫And in Gaza, aim, it is just below the key of day.

4
00:00:50,760 --> 00:01:05,170
‫So it will be pretty easy to type in. ‫Just you need to shrink your writing this finger a little bit and it will get Delattre of him. ‫But in Gaza by you will need to extend your in this finger to the left.

5
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:22,000
‫So let's get started with practice and press the space bar. ‫Now here we are. ‫Now we need to pierce the eye. ‫Let's extend your index finger to the elbow and slightly to the left.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:53,030
‫And this is the eye. ‫And in case of him, just push down your index finger of your right hand to slightly below. ‫And this is the M and hollers. ‫Keep in mind that other fingers should not leave their home key while typing any other key from other ‫law or different positions.

7
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:19,670
‫So let's practice. ‫And always remember that you need to practice enough to get familiar with eight sessions until you move ‫to the next session. ‫And if you have already completed all this lessons before it, then I think you are getting pretty comfortable ‫in that stepping process.

8
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:30,710
‫And from now, you can move forward very fast because you already know how those typing works. ‫And you already have any idea where most of the keys are.

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:30,640
‫Hello and welcome to this new lecture. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to cover the leader of the. ‫And the. ‫So they started their training. ‫In gives of V., we are going to use the index finger of our left hand so that these inserted just below ‫that composition of the index finger of knave can.

2
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:48,820
‫So I need to just move in this finger a little bit down and we get the literal. ‫He. ‫And in Gaza, we. ‫We are going to use the little finger or the pinky finger up our right hand.

3
00:00:49,360 --> 00:01:02,380
‫So it is the top of the home, key of right pinky finger, which is the semicolon. ‫So we need to move up our right pinky finger. ‫Then we can get the lateral.

4
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:18,420
‫So let's get it started with their training. ‫Now, here is the V for that, we need to push down our left index finger a little bit and we get the ‫letter of he had is the letter P.

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:33,160
‫And in this case, we're going to move up R, right. ‫Been giving a little break and we get the little P. ‫Might we also need to pierce the shaved by the left pinky finger like that.

00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:16,180
‫Hello and welcome. ‫And in this that we're going to learn that best typing of. ‫It's an interpretive sign or the. ‫Backslash site. ‫So let's get started.

2
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:33,750
‫In gives up X, we are going to use our ring finger of the left hand. ‫And at first, it will feel pretty weird to use because of the angle, but you'll get used to it.

3
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:53,820
‫So the ACIS inserted just below that is key. ‫Loses their home position of your left ring finger. ‫But it is at the slightly right side. ‫So you need to move down your left ring finger with an angle to their right.

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:10,840
‫And it gives up the interpretive sign. ‫We are going to use the pinky finger of our right hand. ‫And it is going to be pretty easy because we can move our wreckage and finger in this direction.

5
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:22,040
‫Hazily. ‫So it is just below the composition of right pinky finger, which is the semicolon. ‫Just move down here. ‫Right. ‫Pinky finger a little bit.

6
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:38,700
‫And you the question mark. ‫Are they interpretive sign? ‫So this is the Espers bar and get it started with their training. ‫And here is the interactive map to use the Internet if we need to parse that shape.

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:52,970
‫And in this case, as we are going to use the right hand group, is the interrogative mark or coarsen ‫Mark. ‫So we need to parse the live cheap key by the pinky finger up or left hand.

8
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:05,930
‫Then there's the interpretive sign by your right pinky finger. ‫And if we is that interpretive sign without placing the sheet, you do not be the interpretive sign.

9
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:19,940
‫It will be just the backslash. ‫Hollers, Keep in mind that YouTube is the shaped to make an interactive sign. ‫And if you are going to use the backslash, you don't need to pass a sign.

10
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:37,160
‫So keep practicing. ‫And be careful every day is because it is going to be pretty difficult for fast, pure practices, then ‫it will be OK. ‫So keep practicing until you get familiar with the aches and integrative sign.

‫Hello and welcome to this new league term. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to cover four kids who he said take opening and closing back at our ‫first Birkitt.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:31,520
‫Then the hyphen or downgrade score. ‫So let's get it started and start our training. ‫And here we are. ‫So in order troupers, that's it. ‫We need to use that pinky finger upper left hand.

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:45,410
‫We need to push down a little bit. ‫And we are going to get the Jackie. ‫And it'll be really comfortable because with this new trashing the joint, then we will get the check ‫from the air.

4
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:59,320
‫And it gives up the brackets for the opening bracket. ‫We are going to use the middle finger of our right hand and close up the closing bracket. ‫We are going to use the ring finger, upper right hand.

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:17,090
‫And in gives of the hype and we are going to use the pinky finger off my right hand. ‫So let's get started. ‫And now had the jet comes in our trip, is that in the capital we're going to use our right hand?

6
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:34,020
‫Because the shape of the right side. ‫Then we are going to use the pinky finger up our left hand. ‫Is that it? ‫Like that? ‫And now had the opening back, it comes in order to do that.

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:47,940
‫We are going to use the right middle finger. ‫Mark Cooper is the bracket and not mine. ‫We need to pierce the shaped by the opposite hand was in this case is the left hand.

8
00:01:48,510 --> 00:02:03,600
‫So we are going to press the left chimpsky my left pinky finger, then. ‫Questioner Right. ‫Middle finger who plays the opening bracket. ‫And now that we are going to be back at the normal and had the closing bracket comes.

9
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:21,570
‫So we are going to use the right chain finger. ‫But going forward to press the chip, keep the left pinky finger. ‫Otherwise it would be a zero. ‫So I think this is the only listens higher.

10
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:37,980
‫We're going to practice for case and it is going to be a little bit more. ‫So practice enough. ‫Go get comfortable with this case because the brackets are going to be difficult because they're inserted ‫two rows.

11
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:53,610
‫I hope the home key. ‫So we need to extend your fingers a little bit and it will be angled for the will to do that. ‫And also in case of the high. ‫So keep practicing until you get used to this.

‫Are the kids from on two? ‫Nine and zero. ‫So we are going to practice this case now. ‫Actually, it is going to be pretty easy because we have already learned.

3
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:42,760
‫And if I were passed typing. ‫So let's start from the left. ‫First, there is the on our desk Clemson Mark. ‫We have already practiced. ‫That is Clemson sign by piercing shaped and then the exclamation sign.

4
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:55,510
‫So you are already familiar with this? ‫We are going to use the left pinky finger to press the on then in gives up too. ‫We are going to use the left ring finger.

5
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:10,210
‫Forty eight will be left middle finger and the left index finger will cover five and four. ‫So this is it for the left hand. ‫And for the right hand.

6
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:27,760
‫The six and seven key will be placed by this finger at the right hand. ‫Then eight will be pressed by the middle finger of right hand. ‫And we have already packed is the opening and closing bracket of first bracket four nine.

7
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:39,980
‫We are going to use the right ring finger. ‫And for Gedo, it will be right pinky finger. ‫So let's get it started with the practice. ‫And this is our deep ten.

8
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:54,570
‫And here is the numerics, the lesson number 16. ‫We are going to skip this special characters on because the special characters, too, will call fireboat, ‫the special characters on Antle.

9
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:09,870
‫That means all of their special characters. ‫So let's start their training where the numerics. ‫And here we're so placing your hand in the home position, then there's the Espers Berquist.

10
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:23,440
‫All the letters will be the same man. ‫This packed sessions contains some of the new Medek that we need to place. ‫So now we are going to press on by the left pinky finger.

11
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:35,470
‫Then the comma, it did be make the normal, then the six. ‫And we are going to use their left index finger. ‫Then zero will be the right ring finger. ‫And again, nine.

12
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:51,690
‫He did repairs pay, right, middle finger. ‫So I think you have already got it. ‫If you cannot remember who is finger to Hudes, you can always sit there in a station and below.

‫Hello and welcome to this new lecture. ‫And in this letter, we are going to talk about the numpad or no back. ‫So let's first talk about the home position in case of this number back in here.

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:30,270
‫This middle row, which is four, five and six, is the home position. ‫So you're in this finger of the right hand. ‫We be on for. ‫Then the middle finger of the right hand will be on fire.

3
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:51,380
‫And the ring finger will be on six. ‫Now your time will be on the zero. ‫And the pinky finger will be on this in Turkey. ‫Luck is in that vertical line, except zero will be pressed by the index finger.

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:14,860
‫And all this key in this lane, except the detail will be pressed by the right middle finger. ‫And these straw will be pressed by right ring finger. ‫And in case of the pinky finger, the minus plus and the inter will be pressed by pinky finger.

5
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:30,250
‫So let's get started with their training. ‫There are actually two lessons. ‫This one's 19 and 20. ‫How about that number back? ‫But we are going to do the second one because it will cover time.

6
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:44,660
‫I'm back on lessons also. ‫So let's start there. ‫Training. ‫And Haria. ‫So as Dana Station, it is saying, could take home proposition. ‫I have already done that.

7
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:57,400
‫Now Lesperance does this bar. ‫And here you go. ‫Hesperus on my right index finger. ‫Then three, who should be the right ring finger? ‫Then the backslash.

8
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:11,830
‫Who is still with them? ‫Right. ‫Middle finger. ‫So it is pretty easy because all lackies are in the same law. ‫Along with the finger. ‫So we need to just move up and down.

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:31,570
‫We don't need to go to the right or left or anything that I think it is not important to you to land ‫their past typing or very fast typing on this number pad unless you are so little or no like calculation ‫or data entry.

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:44,740
‫But if you are a programmer or article writer or a content creator, then you are going to use the numeric ‫case on the letters. ‫So if you're invested, then try to practice it.

11
00:02:44,920 --> 00:03:02,440
‫Otherwise, it is not so much important for you. ‫So keep practicing. ‫And from the next lecture. ‫We are going to talk about some use full keyboard shortcut, which will help you to boost your productivity ‫and help you to type faster.

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:16,350
‫Hello and welcome to this new lecture. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to learn about some Schuckert case. ‫Who is we can use to Arquit or are. ‫So I have to open my Microsoft.

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:35,150
‫And that is in history here. ‫It is an English story about a man and his son. ‫It is just a demo paragraph. ‫So we are used to the Arrow Becker space and Delate case working with a single character at a time mark.

3
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:51,140
‫However, we can add the control key to have them effect into arts or paragraph at the same time. ‫So listen, I work some shortcuts. ‫Suppose the car, sir, is in here just up to the DRDO of asking.

4
00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:04,330
‫So we own this car, sir. ‫At the beginning of the previous. ‫Ah, we can do that by clicking on that position by the mouse. ‫But we can do that also shortcut.

5
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:23,570
‫So the shortcut key is control and live cattle. ‫So if I press control and left at all, it will take us to the beginning of the art of asking. ‫Now if I again do that, it would move that our sir to the beginning of the previous hour.

6
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:37,600
‫If we aren't to move the cursor to the beginning of the next start, we need to build the control and ‫drive cattle. ‫So let's do that. ‫And Harry, I suppose I own the car, sir.

7
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:56,810
‫Just at the beginning of the may start. ‫He his. ‫I'm going to press control and right. ‫Arrow and Haria. ‫So by this we can move our car, sir, to the beginning of a new arc which is either the next turn of ‫the previous on no less than a new shortcut.

8
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:10,830
‫It is about bulleting the previous art of the next drop. ‫Suppose we are in this game to be deleted. ‫We can do that by pressing control and back Espers.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:24,230
‫So by pressing control and backspace, it really lit the previous art like that. ‫And if I want to delay the next start, this is the game we need to press control and delay it.

10
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:41,380
‫And now the word has been deleted. ‫Suppose we own the car, sir. ‫Too bad the beginning of all this. ‫Taste this at the beginning of this fast lane. ‫We can do that by pressing control and pedal now.

11
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:54,850
‫Hey it. ‫Now if we own the car, sir. ‫Gooby at the end of all this taste. ‫We can do that by pressing control and down arrow there. ‫See. ‫And here it is.

12
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:06,540
‫And ink is if you are a Mac user. ‫You can use the option key instead of the control key. ‫They will are just like the same. ‫See you in the next lecture.

00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:14,200
‫Hello and welcome. ‫And in this lecture, we are going to talk about some shark. ‫Who is. ‫We can use to select different text. ‫So let's get this started and head is out.

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:34,710
‫Pack it up. ‫Suppose the car, sir, in here stopped at the art of Young and we own to select a character. ‫My character SuBo too young to select the last character who says, gee, we can do that by pressing ‫shape and lift arrow like that.

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:47,760
‫Now disease is selected. ‫If we on to select like father like in then you then or we can just again is the left Taraki and it ‫will get selected like that.

4
00:00:50,040 --> 00:01:00,630
‫And suppose we own that next character or the character on the right side of the car, sir, to be selected. ‫We can do that by pissing shift and the right arrow.

5
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:14,100
‫This is the right arrow and Chave to select the aim. ‫Then it will selected the A in and so on. ‫So we have used the shortcut to select the character.

6
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:29,110
‫Now let's see. ‫Left some lines in order to select a line. ‫We can parse the shift and the up arrow to select the line like that. ‫So it will select a single line.

7
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:41,130
‫Just start just as starting from the cursor through the exact same position of the upper line. ‫And in case of the blue line, we are going to use the shift.

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:02:00,320
‫And down at Oki's. ‫And it will select the sentence from this ramp to this graduation like that. ‫Now, if we want to select the paragraphs, we are going to use the shaped control and up at all.

9
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:15,980
‫It will select all the text after the title. ‫Then it also goes down. ‫If we use control shift and down arrow. ‫So it slips all look dazed from the car, sir.

10
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:29,720
‫I put the finishing of the text. ‫Now, if we want to say like that dazed from this car, sir, through the beginning of the line, we ‫can do that. ‫We need troopers shift and home to select that days.

11
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:43,730
‫We do in the car, sir. ‫And the beginning of the timeline. ‫And if we want to select all the text we do in the car, sir. ‫And the ending of the Green Line, we need to replace shift an end like that.

12
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:55,860
‫And if we want to select all the text, we need to press the control. ‫And I hope we already know that because it is pretty common shortcut. ‫So see you in the next lecture.

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:14,340
‫Hello and welcome. ‫And in this letter, we are going to talk about some shockers. ‫Who is we can use in editing? ‫I think many of you already know some of the shortcuts.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:28,460
‫But let's get into that again. ‫In order to copy art or any taste, we need to press control. ‫See? ‫Suppose we own this young art could be copied. ‫We just need to pierce congruency.

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:44,430
‫And if we don't grow past it, it will be controlled. ‫And if we undercut any taste, we need to press control X and you can again bested by Congruently to ‫undo an action.

4
00:00:45,490 --> 00:01:01,550
‫The shortcut keys control ended. ‫Suppose I have delivered this. ‫Now we need to undo the effect. ‫How do we control that? ‫Like that. ‫And if you want to read to that effect, it will be control.

5
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:13,280
‫And I now suppose we own this entire sentence to be bold. ‫Have selected that to make a sentence ball. ‫We need to select that. ‫And the short shortcut, case control.

6
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:25,440
‫And we now it is ball topples. ‫We own this next lane to be Italy. ‫So I have selected that line and the shortcut for that is control. ‫And I now italic.

7
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:38,420
‫We can also make a line underlined by pressing on cruel. ‫And, you know, the line is underlined. ‫You can also find any taste by using control if. ‫And find the text.

8
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:54,510
‫Let's see those hand. ‫And here it is. ‫So this a double shot glass? ‫I think it will help you out because if you don't need to click the mouse or move your hand from your ‫keyboard to the mouse, it will save a lot of time and your energy.
